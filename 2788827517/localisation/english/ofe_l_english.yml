 START_SCREEN_ORIGIN_OFE_FALLEN_EMPIRE_MATERIALIST:0"Our civilization began with a desire for discovery.\n\nAt the beginning, we explored our home. Soon, we successfully completed the development of hyper drive and entered the space age. After that, we began to face the boundless universe bravely. We adventure among the stars, discover long extinct civilizations, absorb their heritage and learn from the past. Relying on this knowledge, we grow rapidly. Through decades of expansion and the development of scientific research, we are not afraid of the hidden things behind the veil of reality.\n\nAfter several centuries, we who focus on the deepest mysteries of the universe ignore the feelings of the robots around us. With the help of an extremely small loophole in the underlying code, the Machine Uprising broke out - causing untold harm to homes and people, and the method of operating the Master Archive containing our knowledge collection of five galaxy ages was destroyed. Therefore, we entered a state of isolation, no longer paid attention to the things of galaxies, and no longer developed... Until today."
 START_SCREEN_ORIGIN_OFE_FALLEN_EMPIRE_SPIRITUALIST:0"Our civilization begins with spiritual pursuit.\n\nReligious pioneers lead us to overcome difficulties and guide our development. Soon, we successfully completed the development of hyper drive and entered the space age. After that, we began to seek the guidance of fate among the stars. One day, the pioneers discovered the existence of "the Shroud" - a plane driven by thinking and emotion. Through the Shroud, we have gained unimaginable power, and even the most remote corners of the galaxy can hear the spread of our doctrines.\n\nHowever, unconsciously, some explorers of the Shroud were bewitched by the evil gods in the Shroud. They distort our doctrines, create heresies, and grow in secret. Finally, the rebellious war broke out. Although we finally eliminated heresy, we also paid a painful price and even wavered in our faith. Therefore, we entered a state of isolation, began to cultivate and live, washed our hearts by paying homage to the holy world, no longer paid attention to the sundries of the galaxy, and no longer developed... Until today."
 START_SCREEN_ORIGIN_OFE_FALLEN_EMPIRE_XENOPHILE:0"Our civilization began with a love of novelty.\n\nAt the beginning, we explored our home. Soon, we successfully completed the development of hyper drive and entered the space age. After that, with a love for the mysteries of the universe, we began to visit the space. We have met different races, helped them develop, absorbed their strengths, and continued to grow. Then, as we grew stronger, we brought these weak races under protection so that they could develop peacefully. \n\nHowever, hundreds of years later, one race was not satisfied with the status quo, colluded with other ambitious races and launched a betrayal war. Finally, we calmed the war, paid a high price, and the protected race suffered great hardships. After that, frustrated, we released the race with self-protection, entered a state of isolation, no longer developed, and just silently observed the young race in the universe... Until today."
 START_SCREEN_ORIGIN_OFE_FALLEN_EMPIRE_XENOPHOBE:0"Our civilization begins with the superiority of our race.\n\nWe stood out from the billions of races on our home planet and conquered it. But we are not satisfied with this. Soon, we successfully completed the development of hyper drive and entered the space age. After that, we began to take the boundless universe as the goal of our conquest. There is no doubt that we are the most outstanding race in the universe. One civilization after another has either surrendered to us or turned into dust.\n\nHowever, as our territory continues to expand, our control over other races continues to decline, and the result is the outbreak of rebellion. Although we finally wiped out the rebels, we were greatly weakened. Finally, we abandoned a large number of unnecessary peripheral territories and entered a state of isolation. We no longer pay attention to the things of galaxies and no longer develop... Until today."
