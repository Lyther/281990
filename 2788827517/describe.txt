This mod is simply the origin mod of the fallen empire. In this mod, you can choose the origin of "Elder Race" to become one of the five fallen Empires at the beginning, and experience the fallen life close to the original.

Support English, Chinese and Russian.

The game content in this mod is based on the base game event changes, occasionally expanded, and there are almost no additional events.

When the conditions are met, you can ask for or help the new empires, punish the countries that disrespect you, and guide the scions.

When the time comes, you can choose to awaken, declare ancient rivals, win over other countries to launch a war in heaven, or lead the galaxy against the crisis.

Before awakening, you can't expand and build ships like other fallen empires. However, in order to enhance the game experience, the hedonist in this mod are reluctant to work (be the specialists), some buildings that could not be built in the past can also be built, and the protector will also provide naval capacity.

TIPS:

• If you want to launch the war in heaven, you need to announce that any unawakened fallen empires into your rival after awakening, and then wait quietly. Do not declare war.

• Recommend to set End-Game Start Year to 2250, if you don't want to observe all the time (The awakening conditions are similar to the original version. The requirements for the military strength of ordinary countries have been reduced, but it still needs to be after the End-Game Start Year).

• By adding an edict, the fallen empire (except machine) can spend 500k unity to awaken in advance.

• Megastructures can still be built.

• the machine fallen empire can only awaken when the contingency comes.

• Don't set the number of fallen empires to 5. In this way, there will be fallen empires with the same ethic as you. 

• Please choose the corresponding initial system when setting the country [ VERY IMPORTANT!!! ].

• Leaders can't be recruited on the first day of the start, just one day later.

• Ships can't be designed. You can only build specific ships through the shipyard.

If you want to design the ship, please additionally subscribe to the subsidiary mod: Origin Fallen Empire: Ship Design Expansion.

There is something wrong, so I can't reply to the comments... There is no big problem with this mod. Problems encountered are usually because of mod conflicts.

I'm busy recently, and probably don't have time to fix some minor bugs.
