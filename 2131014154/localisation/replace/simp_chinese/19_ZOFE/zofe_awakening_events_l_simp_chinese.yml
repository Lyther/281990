We have learned of your current predicament and the spirits were ever so indignant that such actions against the faithful can be taken by another precursor empire.\n\nWhile we cannot intervene in this conflict directly due to prior agreements, many [fallen_empire_supporter.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are ready and willing to defend your worlds, if [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] allows it. We assure you our volunteers are well trained and eager for battle."

The scientific progress of the §H[Root.GetName]§! had been unregulated for some time, and your reckless pursuit of dangerous technologies threaten not only our national security, but also galactic peace.\n\nThis must end now.

 zofe_awakening.202.desc.b:0 "Enough!\n\nYour reckless pursuit of science and your ambition to achieve technological parity with the §H[fallen_empire_warner.GetName]§! must be stopped.

Naturally, anti-tinkering devices have been installed and many of its advanced components had been replaced with cruder, less sophisticated technology, so you are not overly confused by their operations.\n\nShould you succeed and defeat the zealots, it would prove most amusing indeed."
