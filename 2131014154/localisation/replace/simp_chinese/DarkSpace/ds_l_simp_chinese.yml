The large ship has traces of impacts by many different weapons. Probably it was far superior but in the end the numbers killed this behemoth. We have no way to get into the ship.

Everything that happens right now is greater than we could ever become. Our existence became meaningless - our galaxy is nothing more than a galactic zoo. We are objects of a living museum and also the visitors, we are already artifacts of an extinct empire. The truth is hidden in the ashes of the old and new nations and their people. It is a cycle that can not be broken, nature found a way to betray itself. - <Saor>     \n\nWe understand their existence, the reason why they are doing this and why we have to endure it. Life needs order, a structure, progress - to let it flourish. If an old and fragile empire like ours is blocking the pathway to progress, of course we have to disappear. Thats how nature evolves, it was always like that. Especially if the old empires destroy possible grounds to evolve further to perfection, it needs a change. No one who owns some intellect would destroy all the foundation of life - rather the life which is the reason for all the problems to keep a stable future.. - <Qsir> \n\nIt is not really an imprisonment, more probably does the species get a gift of infinite life. The upload of individual traits and securing all kinds of knowledge into an infinite realm strengthens the collective to levels of unknown might. Each unit is able to use knowledge of thousands of people, a power of a united galaxy. This force must be so old, its own origin got lost a long time ago.. - <Novis> \n\nI never expected to see our glorious empire fall. The throne has fallen - all fathers and sons meet a cold death. The remaining ones lie in the ditches and remains of their comrades. Fighting became useless after we failed to find words to descripe our situation. The only consolatory we have left are the last survivors. The general looks at us with a smile, his last words were \"Keep our flag in the air and we have a chance to fly like it in the wind..\" - <Glcítz> \n\nAttention - this is a broadcast of the Qilkanic military! The troops fighting in the hard circumstances in the Filsul-nebula are now also endangered by a coming meteor shower! Many ships and mobile units already got destroyed, also ships of the enemy! Our soldiers fight brave and made great accomplishments. It is only a matter of time until the victory is near! - <Qilkanier>§! \n\nThe data raises more questions than answers.

But this was after our downfall in other parts of the galaxy. The old machines arrived and integrated us into their own dimension of virtual existence.

In the end they were the masterminds of this galaxy. They dominated diplomacy and military. Their power to create new planets was for sure unique. What?, yes they were able to do that.

There were plans to evacuate some parts of the population from different nations and species.
