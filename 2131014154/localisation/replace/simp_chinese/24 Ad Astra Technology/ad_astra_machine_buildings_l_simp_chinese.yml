Yet we have come to hit a fundamental issue that was in a way, unforeseen in our ventures: a truly optimized logistics network.\n\nSpecifically, the issue lies in that while off-world logistics are quite easily handled by the system starbase, on and off-world logistics are hampered by the fact that SSTO technology has specific limitations in terms of bulk transportation, meaning a lot of resources already processed end up in storage until they can be transported off-world.\n\nTogether with a proposal to enhance our near-core mining technology, engineering and logistics sub-units have identified and developed a prototype all-encompassing solution to these specific sets of problems in the form of a dedicated Mining and Logistics Facility - the Tectonic Forge."

What isn't - is its effects that holds it as a whole.\n\nReasonably speaking, the best recourse when engaging the Alpha Fortress is not to attack it head on, but rather to shatter the planet it rests upon ... and hope that it doesn't reappear somewhere else."
 building_orbital_research_uplink:1 "Orbital Research Uplink"
 building_orbital_research_uplink_desc:1 "A massive high-density module separated from the main habitat by dozens of airlocks, triple-reinforced blast doors (several layers in fact) and reinforced ultra-high security sections, the Orbital Research Uplink unit consists of both supermassive research modules, maintenance facilities and databank units that are interconnected with other research facilities on the habitat.\n\nTogether with long-range uplinks with field outposts and satellite facilities in the interstellar void - pre-spaceflight nation sized telescope arrays - the Uplink is able to receive, analyse, process and transmit data results to other key calculation units for further analysis, making it a key piece in the greater research efforts of the Habitat."
 building_foundry_unit:1 "Foundry Unit"
 building_foundry_unit_desc:1 "A massive high-density module packed to its brim with the most advanced manufacturing technologies available to the empire in question. Miner Shuttle Facilities, supermassive Zero-Gravity Foundries and Workshops in addition to smaller habitation facilities for the mining drones all together make it a critical piece in the habitat's manufacturing operations."
 building_orbital_bio_analysis_unit:1 "Orbital Bio-Analysis Unit"
 building_orbital_bio_analysis_unit_desc:1 "A massive high-density module that houses the Habitat's Bio-Analysis Core. A web of Drone Storage Facilities, Launch Bays, Hangar Facilities, Gene-Forges, Hydroponics, Aeroponics and research facilities are all packed into the greater module, with long-range uplinks to a vast network of smaller outposts and facilities throughout the system.\n\nIn all, the Unit detects, tracks, analysis, predicts and then acts on the data that it gathers from both its own operations and from analysing the wider system with significant performance boosts to many of the habitat's operations."
 building_orbital_mirror_core:1 "Orbital Mirror Core"
 building_orbital_mirror_core_desc:1 "A massive high-density module packed to its brim with communication systems - the Orbital Mirror Core is a much smaller variant of the larger Quantum Signal Mirror Cores - designed specifically for Habitat operations. Housing massive intra-communication uplinks for all semi-sapient systems in the entirety of the empire alongside Drone Storage facilities, signal enhancement cores, coordination cores, and maintenance facilities among others - the total sum of the Orbital Mirror Core is a significant overall boost to general system performance across the habitat."
 building_interstellar_coordination_array:1 "Interstellar Coordination Array"
 building_interstellar_coordination_array_desc:1 "A behemoth complex the size of a small mountain range near the capitol itself, the Interstellar Coordination Array is a gargantuan network core - consisting of several massive mountain-sized complexes that together handles the greater Intelligence's C3 Arrays - Command, Control and Communications.\n\nAmidst its endless tunnels and data farms, sub-data farms, sub-sub-data farms and sub-sub-sub-data farms that together form a maze even the best navigation systems can barely keep pace with, coordinator units handle the endless tidal wave of data.\n\nStandard protocols for entering the Coordination Array involves sensory protection, up-to-date navigation systems and for the deeper recesses potentially excavation equipment."
 building_interstellar_conflux_array:1 "Interstellar Conflux Array"
 building_interstellar_conflux_array_desc:1 "Towering high above the stratosphere of the world below and narrowly touching the equivalent altitude of the mesosphere, the Interstellar Conflux Array is the focal point of the entire intelligence's coordination efforts - its untold data-libraries, sub-layers of data-farms and sub-data-farm layers so numerous they form entire districts on their own.\n\nAttempting to path an efficient route through the Array is a long-term effort for a number of continually changing reasons, requiring significant processing power to be diverted in order to ensure the specialized processing of the array is no disrupted."
 building_galactic_network_array:1 "Galactic Network Array"
 building_galactic_network_array_desc:1 "The size of an entire planetary continent, the Galactic Network Array is the penultimate communication hub of the Machine Intelligence that controls it. Artificial mountain ranges all together form a gargantuan web of data-farms and communication hubs that process a staggering quantity of information every standard second.\n\nAt the core of the entire array is the Communication Processing Unit with a communication antenna so colossal it is rivalled only by primitive nations, with endless swarms of courier drones generating enormous clouds as they traverse from one side of the artificial continent to the other, carrying heavier data-packages as they do.\n\nTo traverse the Array is difficult even in the theoretical sense - calculating an optimal path through it without interference requiring significant processing power to achieve, though realistically it could be done in 48 standard years."
