 building_lythuric_compression_refinery_desc:0 "该巨型复合体将莱素气体提炼至极高的密度，将其从气态转化为液态，更容易在合适的低温存储中运输，也更容易散装使用。更小浓度的涉及和安全协议将其分隔开，更容易处理。"
 tech_mine_teldar_mastery:0 "突破：特尔达水晶优化"
 tech_mine_teldar_mastery_desc:0 "Teldar Crystals - as has been stated before - are incredibly durable and dense crystalline structures, which make for some of the most potent Armor-Piercing composites that we've ever produced (trials with making Teldar Crystal Armor is, however, delayed till some inherent issues are resolved). They are, however, unrefined - and while adding layers of crystal material to our kinetic weapons is easy enough, producing a perfectly cut Teldar Crystal tailored to our arsenals requires dedicated facilities."
 building_teldar_crystal_forge:0 "Teldar Crystal Forge"
 building_teldar_crystal_forge_desc:0 "The Teldar Crystal Forge is a heavily guarded facility which lies in a secluded area, away from the main settlements. The scarcity of Teldar Crystals alone is one thing, but the fact is that the forge is a target to many - producing some of the best armor-piercing munitions and reinforced drillbits in our empire."
 tech_mine_yuranic_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Yuranic Crystal Refinements"
 tech_mine_yuranic_mastery_desc:0 "Yuranic Crystals have many, many uses - but most of all, utilizing them for energy-transmissions and energy weaponry is first and foremost on the agenda, as these are by far the most resource-intense. They are, however, quite unrefined - simple refinements are all well and good - but with dedicated facilities, it is possible to reshape the Yuranic Crystals into new, far more efficient forms which can be scaled to any size, greatly boosting our energy production and energy weapon efficiency."
 building_yuranic_crystal_forge:0 "Yuranic Crystal Forge"
 building_yuranic_crystal_forge_desc:0 "The Yuranic Crystal Forge is a marvel to behold from afar for the aesthetically inclined - stray reflections from the crystals making the entire structure gleam like a small mountain of diamonds during the darker hours, which as a direct result requires additional security measures. And sensor protection."
 tech_mine_neutronium_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Neutronium Forge Processes"
 tech_mine_neutronium_mastery_desc:0 "\"Mining\" Neutronium 'Ore' is a bit of an oxymoron. Neutronium is, in fact, a form of liquid that has properties similar to plasma - and is incredibly difficult to extract due to the fact that once even ten percentage of the gravitational pressure involved is loosened, it expands. Rapidly. And very, very violently. Once it IS extracted, however, the issue became simply ... what to do with it.\n\nWhile it's often stated it can be forged into armor, the reality is that what is actually done is that the Neutronium 'ore' is utilized in a process that allows the creation of new hyper-density alloys and materials; not quite Neutronium proper, but definitely close (a micron-thick layer of actual Neutronium across the hull of a Corvette would outstrip the mass of an entire continent) and layering it into pre-existing composites.\n\nWhile we have had some success thus far, we could theoretically refine the process even further - though it would require a facility the size of a small nation, the results would be far, far more potent armor technology and also potentially using Neutronium itself as an extreme-yield explosive."
 building_neutronium_macro_forge:0 "Neutronium Macro-Forge"
 building_neutronium_macro_forge_desc:0 "Considered extremely dangerous to operate in - for obvious reasons - most operations in the Macro-Forge are done either via tele-operation or with super-heavy suits, as the sheer radiation and energy involved in the forge (in addition to wanting to keep impurities away) means it is better to try and keep clear. It is also the reason why the Forge is located far away from any settlements - even a very tiny error in the containment fields equate a very, very, very large explosion."
 building_neutronium_macro_forge_synthetic:0 "Neutronium Macro-Forge"
 building_neutronium_macro_forge_synthetic_desc:0 "Considered extremely dangerous to operate in - for obvious reasons - most operations in the Macro-Forge are done either via specialized super-heavy drones, as the sheer radiation and energy involved in the forge (in addition to wanting to keep impurities away) means it is better to try and keep clear. It is also the reason why the Forge is located far away from any settlements - even a very tiny error in the containment fields equate a very, very, very large explosion."
 tech_mine_dark_matter_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Dark Matter Containment"
 tech_mine_dark_matter_mastery_desc:0 "Dark Matter was for a very, very long time believed to be the single dominant force of matter in the universe - but still vastly eclipsed by Dark Energy. New research into Dark Matter - and the ability to draw it from small, local ultra-high density pockets - has resulted in that theoretically, it could be long-term contained in special facilities. While the full set of details will require special authorization and sanction, in particular for setting up these facilities and allocating the necessary materials, crews, engineers, scientists, shield arrays, bunkers, emergency facilities, non-listed armies and orbital macro-weapons for containment, the gain is significant."

 building_satramene_gas_refinery:0 "Satramene Gas Refinery"
 building_satramene_gas_refinery_desc:0 "This facility - located away from settlements - imports large quantities of Satramene gas for refinement into their liquid form, which has many uses in many fields throughout our empire. Unfortunately, security has to be tripled on a regular basis to the point the facility looks like a fortress, due to the fact that the gas is incredibly valuable."
 tech_mine_garanthium_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Garanthium Engineering"
 tech_mine_garanthium_mastery_desc:1 "The use of Garanthium in starship construction is fairly obvious - it is malleable, it is durable and generally speaking renders most composites far superior when layered with it. However, using it in starships isn't the only thing we can do with Garanthium in practice; refining the material and processing it into new composites, it can be added to a massive range of construction materials and armor - from ships to buildings and smaller yet - though it has the drawback of requiring large quantities of Garanthium."
 building_garanthium_fabricator_forge:0 "Garanthium Fabricator Forge"
 building_garanthium_fabricator_forge_desc:0 "The Garanthium Fabricator Forge constantly produces and recycles Garanthium composite materials which are sent and received from throughout our empire, allowing more starships, armies and planetary structures to be reinforced with the material."
 tech_mine_orillium_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Orillium Explosive Composites"
 tech_mine_orillium_mastery_desc:1 "Orillium Ore is an impressive - if notoriously unstable - mineral; its biggest and most valued trait being quite simply that it makes an absolutely incredible shield emitter material when stabilized, allowing Shield Emitters to be pushed to three, four or even five times their normal capacity without issue. Pursuing a way to mass-produce a significantly more stabilized Orillium is strategically valuable."
 building_orillium_blast_forge:0 "Orillium Blast Forge"
 building_orillium_blast_forge_desc:0 "The name is quite intentional, for the record. This complex is located far from any settlements or other key facilities, as a non-contained, ultra-refined pack of Orillium Ore not meta-stabilized into their final forms equate an unstable explosive material so powerful that replacements have to be regular. Reinforced Blast Protection is strongly recommended."
 tech_mine_living_metal_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Living Alloy Engineering"
 tech_mine_living_metal_mastery_desc:0 "Living Metals - or rather, Semi-Organic Meta-Alloy-Composites as is their full name - are strange composites of metals and various other elements, which are arranged into structures that are as resilient as actual alloys, yet possess a 'memory' capacity that means they will always try to revert to their original 'forged' state.\n\nBy understanding how this process occurs, it is possible to - in a limited way - mimic the process, allowing the creation of structures, armors and craft which can 'heal' themselves to a limited extent over time, counter-acting entropy to a degree. This has resulted in new, stronger and significantly more durable material composites, which require virtually no maintenance and can last for thousands of years - even much, much, much longer if the calculations are correct. Though, it may take a while to determine if they will truly outlast the entire universe."
 building_living_metal_refinery:0 "Living Metal Refinery"
 building_living_metal_refinery_desc:0 "The Living Metal Refinery is one of the rarest buildings in our empire, and guarded by some of the most advanced technology and systems we can provide it. From it, large quantities of fresh-forged Living metal is shipped to a multitude of military and civilian operations throughout our empire alike, tailored to the most precise specifications possible."
 tech_engos_vapor_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Engos Refinement"
 tech_engos_vapor_mastery_desc:3 "Engos Vapor is - aside the very effective and unusual results as a stimulant - a highly effective form of energy conductor. This has led to a need to refine it further; in its current form, the vapor is only partially as effective as it theoretically could be, and have a wide range of applications throughout our empire."
 building_engos_fuel_refinery:0 "Engos Fuel Refinery"
 building_engos_fuel_refinery_desc:0 "This massive refinery produces a semi-liquid form of the Engos Vapor for a large number of uses throughout our empire - its use in energy weapons, energy conductive systems and gene-modifications on every level means that production is always running at high capacity to meet demand."
 building_pitharan_dust_refinery:0 "Pitharan Dust Refinery"
 building_pitharan_dust_refinery_desc:0 "The golden streams of near-liquid Pitharan Dust equates large boosts of crop yields throughout our empire, originating from this facility. The region around it has been noted to be unusually fertile - often to such a point that it is far more work removing the greatly increased vegetation than running production of the facility."
 tech_mine_zro_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Zro Refinement"
 tech_mine_zro_mastery_desc:3 "Refining Zro into a usable form is fairly easy - however, theoretically, it can be greatly enhanced so much further yet through experimental refinement techniques and the use of advanced technology; the end result a form of Liquid Zro so potent and long-lasting that comparing it to the older, less refined form isn't even realistic. However, refinement takes a long time and as such, it will require a dedicated facility with superior security."
 building_zro_vortex_refinery:0 "Zro Vortex Refinery"
 building_zro_vortex_refinery_desc:0 "The Vortex Refinery is at a secret location in a remote area of the region. It is surrounded by many decoy facilities, its appearance closer to a regular, unassuming chemical plant that draws little to no attention. But in the depths of the refinery, Zro is converted into its final, liquid form - a mere drop enough to turn a Psi-gifted individual into a Psionic Juggernaut. Unfortunately for such an individual, the defenses in and outside the Refinery are quite overkill for such an eventuality."
 tech_mine_aldar_mastery:0 "Breakthrough: Aldar Crystal Matrix Manufacturing"
 tech_mine_aldar_mastery_desc:3 "Aldar Crystals are finicky little things. Extremely energy dense, they have a curious way of rapidly expanding and hardening when removed from their 'core' - suggesting some form of chemical reaction or perhaps a hint at a biological origin.\n\nIn any case, they are notoriously difficult to remove from common ores; the standard method works well enough, but refining it to its peak efficiency might allow for a lot more to be recovered. Perhaps even tailored."
 building_aldar_megaforge:0 "Aldar Mega-Forge"
 building_aldar_megaforge_desc:0 "The Mega-Forge is a bit of a lie. The 'Mega' bit - implying colossal size - is in fact reserved for the immensely complex machinery that handles the constant requirement for replacement parts when (not if) there's an accident and an Aldar Crystal breaks unexpectedly (everything in proximity to them has to be triple-armoured as a result).\n\nNaturally, this translates into that every single part of the Forge is deliberately and colossally over-engineered - specifically to withsand an Aldar fragmentation explosion - but the Forge is able to produce some of the most powerful conventional fragmentation weapons possible. That and the fact remains that the common ores filtered out are quite valuable."
