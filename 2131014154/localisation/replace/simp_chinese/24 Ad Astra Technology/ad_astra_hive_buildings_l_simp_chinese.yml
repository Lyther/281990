 building_wyrmguard_citadel_hive:1 "Hybrid Spawn Spire"
 building_wyrmguard_citadel_hive_desc:1 "The Hybrid Spawn Spire. This gigantic Hive Spire - rising high into the world's equivalent of a stratosphere and touching the very edges of its mesosphere - is by far one of the largest buildings of this world; a mountain of starship grade armour and shields, bristling from its base to its peaks with point-defence weaponry, anti-orbital interception cannons, artillery and hangars large enough to house Corvettes.\n\nThose same hangars now serve as the warrens of the greatest weapon this gargantuan fortress has, however - the Wyrmguard. The Drakes, born from specialized warrior drones and deployed alongside strike units of Gene-Warriors patrol the skies of this world from the Spire in large aerospace carriers or atop the backs of the great Drake Drones.\n\nIn the Spire itself, breeding facilities, synaptic cores, habitat warrens, support drone facilities, research laboratories of every kind and manufacturing facilities that produce some of the most high quality equipment the empire can afford make up the core of the Spire - in addition to perfecting the tactics, doctrines and drones behind them; gradually improving upon everything from weapons, shields, armour technologies to tactics, strategies, logistics and overall designs over time.\n\nIn order to engage the Spire - the only effective recourse is to shatter the world it rests upon. Even then, that is not a guarantee.\n\n§YAllows building special armies from this world with corresponding technology.§!"
 building_orbital_research_hive:1 "Orbital Research Hive"
 building_orbital_research_hive_desc:1 "A massive high-density module separated from the main habitat by dozens of airlocks, triple-reinforced blast doors (several layers in fact) and reinforced ultra-high security sections, the Orbital Research Hive brims with layer on layer of Brain Drones continually tending to the information flows of the entire Habitat, carefully coordinating and streamlining the flow to the greatest possible effect while at the same time combing over the information gleamed both from the laboratories on the Habitat and information coming in from other major research sites across the galaxy."
 building_foundry_hive:1 "Foundry Hive"
 building_foundry_hive_desc:1 "A massive high-density module packed to its brim with the most advanced manufacturing technologies available to the empire in question. Miner Shuttle Facilities, supermassive Zero-Gravity Foundries and Workshops in addition to smaller habitation facilities for the mining drones all together make it a critical piece in the habitat's manufacturing operations."
 building_orbital_mutation_hive:1 "Orbital Mutation Hive"
 building_orbital_mutation_hive_desc:1 "A massive high-density module that houses the Habitat's Adaptation Hive. The facility consists of additional hydroponics facilities, spawning pools, research labs, analyst drone facilities, habitat units and operational shuttle facilities - all together boosting the general performance of the habitat as a whole."
 building_orbital_synaptic_nexus:1 "Orbital Synaptic Nexus"
 building_orbital_synaptic_nexus_desc:1 "A massive high-density module packed to its brim with short and long-range synaptic interlinks using a combination of massive meganeurons transmitter webs and special synapse drones. Between them, the Synaptic Nexus rivals any Synaptic Cluster on its own, but serves the foremost purpose of immensely boosting the will and power of the greater hive mind across the habitat."
