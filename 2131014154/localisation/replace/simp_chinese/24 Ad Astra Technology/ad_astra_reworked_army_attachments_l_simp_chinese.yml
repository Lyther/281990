 tech_mobile_fortifications_t1:0 "移动防御工事"
 tech_mobile_fortifications_t1_desc:0 "当我们着手向群星扩张时，我们就将面临大规模的冲突与破坏。无论是否主动索战，我们都需要做好防御准备。\n\n在应用新式技术后，重装运载设备、定点防守型飞行器、移动护盾发生器、路障无人机和哨兵防御系统等都将能提供相当于地堡和标准新固态防御工事的保护。"
 tech_adaptive_fortifications_t2:0 "自适应防御工事"
 tech_adaptive_fortifications_t2_desc:0 "在旧有移动防御工事技术的基础上，我们的研究人员已经设计了新的标准化防御行动训练方案和装备设置，无需增加成本即可提高我们驻军的整体生存几率。\n\n这一升级框架包括强化防护设备、综合点防御系统、重型护盾发生器和基础自适应伪装系统。理论上来说，将其全面应用于现有装备并不困难，但由于运输限制，长期驻守的防御军队将最受其益。"
 tech_mobile_bunkers_t3:0 "移动碉堡"
 tech_mobile_bunkers_t3_desc:0 "我们很容易通过这些更为强大的运兵车和运输车部署小型前沿作战基地和掩体。它们难以被发现，如被锁定还可以移动，即使敌人猛烈轰炸，军队仍可以方便地获得医疗、维修、补给和保护。"
 tech_tectonic_fortress_t4:0 "构造堡垒"
 tech_tectonic_fortress_t4_desc:0 "我们的研究单元与经验丰富的将军合作开发出了一种有望改变战争规则的新式技术。基于我们的移动野战基地技术研发而来，移动碉堡“构造堡垒”实际上是一种轻量级前沿移动作战基地，体型更小更易维护运作，更易批量部署，几乎可以成为远征军和行星防御网络的标配。\n\n然而，它们的速度相对较慢，而且只能用于防御，牺牲了火力来换取更多的后勤和防御优势，在电子干扰/反干扰措施、点防御、装甲和护盾方面拥有足够的保护，想要摧毁它们所需的火力要求近乎星舰级武器。此外，它们还可以单独充当补给碉堡，减少对重型补给线的依赖。"
 tech_interlinked_drone_command_systems_t1:0 "Interlinked Drone Command Systems"
 tech_interlinked_drone_command_systems_t1_desc:0 "Drone technology has been a part of our society for quite a long time. Big, small, we've done most already - some successful, others less so. We've had the issue, however, of our Drones being highly limited in their capacity - they are mostly unable to operate independently, and are limited in their ability, constricted by programming. By creating a 'Master AI' interface based on our Administrative AI systems, however, we can create larger and more potent drones that can greatly help our empire for military and industrial purposes, while at the same time being able to control them with greater ease and heightened security."
 tech_drone_neural_casing_network_t2:0 "Drone Neural Casing Network"
 tech_drone_neural_casing_network_t2_desc:0 "The 'Neural Casing' Network theory - a very fancy way of saying \"semi-brain in a jar\", though this is not entirely accurate - is an intriguing prospect. Very simply, the Neural Casing is effectively speaking a more advanced neural computer system; not equivalent to any of our own brains, but rather optimized to such an extent, that what would require a vehicle sized system now can be scaled down to not even a tenth the size.\n\nThis allows us to create small networks of independent 'controllers' - miniature AIs, each responsible for a small part of the greater whole, which together operate as a crew. This allows for the AI to remain focused on the task at hand, while still remaining unconditionally loyal to its controller due to its inherently limited intelligence, allowing us to control even more massive drones with even greater efficiency, with current optimal designs consisting of super-heavy craft and vehicles that possess platoon-level firepower all on their own. The implications, military and industrial, are tantalizing."
 tech_drone_neural_impulse_unit_t3:0 "Drone Neural Impulse Unit"
 tech_drone_neural_impulse_unit_t3_desc:0 "The Neural Impulse Unit is a landmark achievement for us. In simplicity, the Unit very simply acts as a form of connection, a bridge between a simple AI and its operator, with the latter in control of the former. It is a process that demands advanced cognitive training, even more advanced interface technology and a great deal of refinement in terms of efficiency and technology, but the end results are remarkable, as one linked to the Datascapes can effectively control entire industrial or military armies worth of Drones with next to no difficulty."
 tech_titan_command_matrix_t4:0 "Titan Command Matrix"
 tech_titan_command_matrix_t4_desc:0 "By expanding the training regiments of our Neural Commanders, improving upon the technology and doctrines involved, we have found that there are a select number of Neural Commanders that show exceptional promise - to the point they can with great ease command even super-massive Drones as easily as they do small ones, and in gigantic numbers as well. Designating them Titans, they can control legions of Drones as one with no difficulty, and can greatly aid our industrial and military might."
 tech_interlinked_drone_command_systems_t1_hive:0 "Interlinked Drone Command Systems"
 tech_interlinked_drone_command_systems_t1_hive_desc:0 "Simplistic Robotic technology has been present since the earliest days of the Hive. Inefficient compared to the Mind's Drones, we could nevertheless make use of them in various way that will limit the number of lost drones in large-scale operations. By breeding specialized overlord forms with integrated machine interfaces that can superimpose the will of the Hive Mind upon enhanced inorganic frameworks, the new expendable additions can perform tasks that would outright destroy our own or where the Hive Mind's greater ability is an outright waste."
 tech_drone_neural_casing_network_t2_hive:0 "Drone Neural Casing Network"
 tech_drone_neural_casing_network_t2_hive_desc:0 "We have long considered the theory behind the 'Neural Casing' theory - in effect a replication of a Hive Drone's brain in synthetic form, though it is weaker and less effective; requiring a stronger signal to maintain the necessary hold and worse, suffers from the weaknesses of its inorganic nature. The nature of the Neural Casing, however, allows for system networks that are only a tenth the size of the original ones and allows the Hive Mind a greater hold over our vehicle fleets without risking unnecessary Hive Drone losses.\n\nTogether with more evolved, specially bred Overlord Drones that are significantly more augmented with technology to strengthen the Hive Mind's link to the Drone Fleets, result is a super-heavy fleet of crafts and vehicles that can significantly bolster the efficiency of Hive Drones, in particular by mitigating losses of organic drones."
 tech_drone_neural_impulse_unit_t3_hive:0 "Drone Neural Impulse Unit"
 tech_drone_neural_impulse_unit_t3_hive_desc:0 "Risk is outweighed by reward. The Neural Impulse Unit is a major achievement in itself - connecting the artificial non-organic intelligences of the more simplistic Neural Casings in perfect synchronicity with the greater Hive Mind, extending its will upon the non-organic datascapes through the Overlord Forms, utterly dominating every circuit and codeline. The resultant machines are now a part of the Hive Mind - with no thought of ability of their own save what the Hive Mind wills."
 tech_titan_command_matrix_t4_hive:0 "Titan Command Matrix"
 tech_titan_command_matrix_t4_hive_desc:0 "The power of the Hive Mind over the datascapes has grown to new heights. No longer are we limited to merely commanding, but extending out into the very circuitry and the codelines, allowing a level of control that synthetics would struggle to fathom. There is no part of the circuitry that the Hive cannot reach. No code that is foreign or uncertain in its purpose. The Hive can now control entire legions of mechanical Drones as easily as its organic forms."
 tech_enhanced_swarm_sensor_fusion_t1:0 "Enhanced Swarm Sensor Fusion"
 tech_enhanced_swarm_sensor_fusion_t1_desc:0 "Enhanced algorithms for sensor fusion and sensor coordination between localized drone units equate a localized hyper-encrypted cloud from which sensor and positioning data can be pulled by all localized frames, optimizing operations and allowing detection of faults and errors in frameworks before they occur, as well as optimize targeting for micro-point defense networks and long-range targeting, in addition to having non-combat applications in industrial operations."
 tech_mobile_super_heavy_drone_hubs_t2:0 "Mobile Super-Heavy Drone Hubs"
 tech_mobile_super_heavy_drone_hubs_t2_desc:0 "Large highly mobile super-heavy Drone Hubs that are able to perform localized maintenance and boost the signal to the main network is a cost-effective solution to many problems faced by field frameworks. Drones can now be refueled, recharged and repaired quickly in the field and receive software and hardware updates and upgrades far more rapidly, allowing more rapid adaptation both in military and industrial applications."
 tech_drone_carriers_t3:0 "Drone Carriers"
 tech_drone_carriers_t3_desc:0 "Expanding upon the older Mobile Drone Hubs with new, supermassive semi-autonomous carrier units - the size of or larger than an organic pre-FTL supercarrier - that continually analyze and act according to incoming sensory data in a semi-independent fashion, requiring less processing power from the network to operate. Their large size and major internal network and hardware facilities allow for rapid modification of drones in the field to new specifications as well as enhanced synchronization links to the primary network."
 tech_drone_dreadnoughts_t4:0 "Drone Dreadnoughts"
 tech_drone_dreadnoughts_t4_desc:0 "Twice the size of older Drone Carriers, the Dreadnoughts are effectively all the older Drone Carriers were and more. Outfitted with latest generation of enhanced Point-Defense Networks and Shield Generators in addition to super-heavy artillery weapons (all categories), they possess an enhanced suite of technologies across the board and are able to recycle and repair damaged frameworks rapidly, as well as possessing a much more powerful long-range link to the primary network.\n\nNon-combat variants are able to operate as mobile refinery and energy collector facilities in addition to optimizing local power grid units, equating an increased energy and mineral budget overall."
 tech_drone_planetary_fleets_t5:0 "Drone Planetary Fleets"
 tech_drone_planetary_fleets_t5_desc:0 "Synchronized links between individual Planetary Dreadnoughts in large-scale planetary fleets that are integrated as standard in all armed force units equates a massive armada of units that are vastly superior in efficiency to their predecessor models.\n\nEnhanced connections to the network and onboard processor facilities equate a complete negation of the need for semi-autonomy, though if connection is weak or failing, semi-autonomous capabilities remain in order to retain optimized ability. End result is effectively a planetary fleet of Dreadnoughts that in warfare can lock down entire regions with little effort - and in non-combat roles equate mobile super-heavy Drone Hubs, Refineries and Processors able to greatly enhance drone performance across the board."
 tech_clone_commandos_t1:0 "Clone Commandos"
 tech_clone_commandos_t1_desc:0 "Among our Clones, there's a rare few that have shown exceptional promise - odd quirks that have developed into full-blown talents elevating above and beyond their peers.\n\nBy isolating these traits and bolstering the training of the clones even further - with some additional augmentations in addition to that, we can create a special cadre of Commandos that are strong, fiercely loyal and adaptable. Applying the knowledge we gain as a result to our armies as a whole equate a stronger force overall."
 tech_replicant_commandos_t2:0 "Replicant Commandos"
 tech_replicant_commandos_t2_desc:0 "Significant strides in genetic augmentation technology has resulted in new generations of more advanced and potent clones and Clone Commandos; however, there have also been several breakthroughs in the development of semi-organic technology, specifically a range of less advanced cybernetics - reinforced bone structure, hardened skin and so forth - in addition to some application of simpler robotics.\n\nResult is a new generation of Clone Commandos and effective upgrades to the older Clone Commandos - referred to as Replicant Commandos - that exceed the originals in both life-span and raw power. Issue is that they are fewer than the originals; each Replicant unique due to the significant investment and time required, in particular to the necessary cybernetic enhancements. What they lack in numbers, however, they make up for in ability."
 tech_project_star_shield_t3:0 "Project Star Shield"
 tech_project_star_shield_t3_desc:0 "We know our Replicant Commandos - their ability, their strengths, their weaknesses. And we know, that we can push them even further. Our researchers, in conjunction with our senior command, have devised an advanced training and augmentation regiment for a select number of Replicant Commandos and a number of our most elite units that have shown exceptional promise, codenamed Star Shield, which involves further genetic and cybernetic augmentations in addition to even harsher and more advanced training regiments.\n\nThese new Stellar Commando teams are exceptional. Having undergone some of the harshest training regiments imaginable in addition to extensive enhanced augmentations, they are incredibly resilient and experienced teams that are typically dispatched on missions so dangerous or even outright suicidal that chances of return are slim to none. Yet despite that, the earliest of these Stellar Commandos have proven to beat the odds again and again where others would have failed."
 tech_force_legion_t4:0 "Force Legion"
 tech_force_legion_t4_desc:0 "Our success with Project Star Shield did not go unnoticed. But we are not finished yet. Of the ranks of the Stellar Commandos and our most elite fighting forces, a few select teams proved to be so far beyond their peers, that they caught our attention and subsequent investigation.\n\nRecognizing them as what they are, there have been calls to create an entirely new Special Force Unit - for the most extreme and dangerous missions, the truly impossible. Given our best equipment, augmentations, armor and technology, these few would be the Star Shield's finest. We call them the Force Legion."
 tech_order_commandos_t1:0 "Order Commandos"
 tech_order_commandos_t1_desc:0 "The Order is a strange faction which only recently has shown themselves in our space. Consisting of very powerful Psionics, the Order offers us their unconditional aid in exchange for a permanent base of operations on a remote world inside of our territory.\n\nTo prove their worth, they have shown themselves excelling in using their abilities and no small amount of diplomatic cunning to quell conflicts. They have also offered to assist us in the training of some of our more psionically sensitive recruits - curiously enough, they spend a great deal of time together with our Clone forces, often operating in highly effective commando teams."
 tech_order_wardens_t2:0 "Order Wardens"
 tech_order_wardens_t2_desc:0 "The Order, while still not fully trustworthy in our eyes, have proven themselves incredibly valuable regardless. Some elements in our empire argue they should be removed, but so far the Order does not seem to have any intent on anything but fulfilling their obligation towards us.\n\nNow, they approach us with a new offer - using our gene-tailoring technology and more advanced training regiments, they can create immensely strong Psionic Fighters able to go toe-to-toe with even our most advanced infantry - having proven highly skilled in Psionics and melee combat (to incredible effect even on a modern battlefield). Their presence in the field is both intimidating ... and inspiring."
 tech_guardian_temple_t3:0 "The Guardian Temple"
 tech_guardian_temple_t3_desc:0 "The Order have now fully established themselves on their given world, having finished construction of what they call \"The Guardian Temple\". From there, they gather knowledge from all throughout our Empire and employ it towards greatly stabilizing and strengthening the empire as a whole through diplomacy or power - though their loyalty towards our empire is now all but a proven fact, as we know all that transpires in the temple.\n\nThe Order has, however, made an offer to allow a limited recruitment drive of a number of the Temple's 'Guardians' - exceptionally potent Psionics, fighters and diplomats - who offer their services to our empire ... should we accept their aid."
 tech_lords_of_the_order_t4:0 "Lords of the Order"
 tech_lords_of_the_order_t4_desc:0 "At last, the rulers of the Order - or so we believe, we are not certain - emerge from hiding. We admit, when we first encountered them, we were not sure what to make of them.\n\nWielding immense powers and seemingly unable to age, the leaders of the Order seem to have no intention to do anything other than aid our empire as they work towards some goal we have yet to ascertain, but from what it seems, that goal appears to align with our own intents.\n\nAlways singular in their travels and upon the battlefields, they are effective the thermonuclear equivalent of Psionic potential; some even call them 'things of eternity' for reasons they do not truly understand. Alone, they can sway worlds with diplomatic potency - and in battle, rally armies or channel their psionic might into defensive and offensive feats that can only be defined as outright magic."
 tech_commissar_squads_t1:0 "Commissar Squads"
 tech_commissar_squads_t1_desc:0 "As we reach towards the stars, we face ever greater and more terrible threats. Ranks may shake and waver - but they can never be allowed to break. There must be a rank and file that sees to both planetary security and that of our expeditionary forces. A formation of the most unwavering loyal - yet also wisest - in our lines. To be loyal is not enough. To know when, how and where to push, discipline or punish is a heavy task in itself."
 tech_praetor_squads_t2:0 "Praetor Squads"
 tech_praetor_squads_t2_desc:0 "In the ranks of our Commissars, there is a significant number of battle-hardened veterans who have come to rise above all others. Referred to as Praetors, these individuals have come to form a new training regime based upon their experience and knowledge in the field - resulting in a new generation of Commissars that are stronger and more well-trained, in addition to having superior equipment overall."
 tech_judge_squads_t3:0 "Judge Squads"
 tech_judge_squads_t3_desc:0 "The success of our Enforcers is unquestionable. Yet there is more to be done. Disorder is a fact - the violation of law and order in both the ranks of the battlefield and upon our colonies exist; elements, extremists, radicals that would see our hard work undone.\n\nThis will not stand. A complete reformation of the Commissars - into an effective, militarized law enforcement in our colonies as well as upon the battlefield - making them our foremost in the defense of our empire. Where they walk, they shall be the law."
 tech_ultimate_sanction_t4:0 "The Ultimate Sanction"
 tech_ultimate_sanction_t4_desc:0 "There is a rumor - persistent theories and folly - of an inquisitorial organization. There exists no such thing. But if it did exist, it would be an organization given the full backing of our empire to root out traitors and deviants with the best weapons, armor, augmentations and craft our empire can build ... and the rights to take whatever measures, however extreme, to safeguard our empire.\n\nOf course, it's all just rumors."
 tech_xeno_cavalry_t1:0 "Xeno Cavalry"
 tech_xeno_cavalry_t1_desc:0 "Through advanced genetic tailoring and hard work, these sturdy war beasts make excellent mounts, once they have finished bonding with their riders - an elite cadre of commandos specialized in long-range operations. They can traverse almost any terrain, and have proven very effective in scouting and raiding roles. Larger specimens have also been used with success as heavy weapon platforms and logistical support platforms."
 tech_xenosequence_hybridization_t2:0 "Xenosequence Hybridization"
 tech_xenosequence_hybridization_t2_desc:0 "In the ranks of the Xeno Cavalry, there's a number of so-called \"Hybrid Warriors\"; Xeno Cavalry Commandos that have - together with their beasts - undergone advanced gene therapies that have resulted in them sharing many traits with one another; the end result an incredibly strong bond and significantly increased strength, speed, intellect and stamina for beast, rider or both - in the first case, to the point of sapience in some cases equal to the rider.\n\nThey are quite fearsome in battle, yet their most notable traits is that they can undertake operations far from any and all support. Some of our empire find this highly suspect and question even these early stages - yet the results cannot be denied to be beneficial."
 tech_xenomass_augmentation_t3:0 "Xenomass Augmentation"
 tech_xenomass_augmentation_t3_desc:0 "There's a few among the Hybrid Warriors that are exceptional - unique, even - to the point they have earned special recognition above their peers. Most notably, their level of genetic and to an extent cybernetic augmentations (both beast and rider) have resulted in that they are far stronger, faster, smarter and more durable than most others - the bond between rider and beast virtually unbreakable.\n\nThis has led to the potential to build upon it by the use of specialized bio-technological suits - Bio-Suits for short - that enhance performance even further through various technologies, tailored to each and every rider and beast; but there have also been calls to form a special cadre of both beast and rider; referred to as Bio-Force Commandos."
 tech_immortals_t4:0 "Immortals"
 tech_immortals_t4_desc:0 "Some time ago, we received calls through ... intelligence channels of a potential recruitment prospect - from an intermediary we are familiar with, called the Chozin. Very simply, the Chozin once assisted us in gaining the aid of a powerful Bounty Hunter many years prior; the mission in question was a complete success and the Bounty Hunter left - never to return. Now, the Chozin have contacted us again, offering up the services of their foremost elite to our cause ... if we can pay for it.\n\nThere is precious little known about these strange warriors, mercenaries and bounty hunters that now answer our call. What is known, is that they are in every sense second to none amongst our forces.\n\nTheir skill with every weapon we have ever devised is virtually unmatched. Stranger still are their bizarre power suits, which attempts at scanning have yielded nothing on. We can only guess who or what they are.\n\nBut we do know this: as much as it may seem hyperbole on the part of the Chozin ... the Immortals ... they indeed live up to their name."
 tech_xeno_cavalry_t1_hive:0 "Xeno Cavalry"
 tech_xeno_cavalry_t1_hive_desc:0 "The Hive Mind encompasses all. Through heavy genetic modification and integration into the greater mind, the assimilation of non-sapient xenomorph life-forms is a trivial task overall. However, be implementing particular breeds of these new life-forms into the Hive Mind, we can create specialized Xenomorphic Fighters that operate in close-synch packs that are ideal for raiding or scouting operations - as well as being able to traverse virtually any terrain barring a few extreme exceptions ... without technological assistance, that is.\n\nThe largest versions of this new Xeno Cavalry can carry large siege weapons with ease, alternatively serve as super-heavy logistical platforms relative to their size."
 tech_xenosequence_hybridization_t2_hive:0 "Xenosequence Hybridization"
 tech_xenosequence_hybridization_t2_hive_desc:0 "The merger of Xenomorph genetic code with special-bred warrior forms has resulted in an entirely new generation of prototype warrior forms. Larger, stronger, faster, smarter and hardier overall, the Xenomorphic Hybrid Warriors are vastly superior to normal warrior forms, but are few in number.\n\nStreamlining genetic assimilation process and strengthening the Hive Mind's link to the Hybrid Warriors will equate a significantly more potent force - replacing the older, weaker xenomorphic gene strains completely and significantly boosting the performance of our warrior forms."
 tech_xenomass_augmentation_t3_hive:0 "Xenomass Augmentation"
 tech_xenomass_augmentation_t3_hive_desc:0 "Fully merging the genetic codes of special-tailored warrior forms with xenomorphic genetic code - and vice versa - has resulted in a new generation of warrior forms that are unique even among the Hybrid Warriors. Their massive forms are further reinforced by a bio-engineered chitin and heavily enhanced bone structure - in conjunction with a significant number of bio-implants tailored towards pain suppression and combat performance augmentation, the end result is a new form of Hybrid Warrior that is significantly more potent than virtually all previous strains, further enhancing our Warrior forms."
 tech_immortals_t4_hive:0 "Immortals"
 tech_immortals_t4_hive_desc:0 "Many years ago, the Hive Mind enlisted the aid of a force/individual/faction known as the Chozin, procuring assistance in a matter of urgency that threatened the entire Hive Mind and ultimately the greater galaxy. The threat was neutralized by the Chozin's agent - the agent withdrawing upon completion of the contract, never to be seen again by the Hive Mind.\n\nNow, the Chozin have established contact again with an offer to the Hive Mind - a suite of enhanced evolutionary technologies and genetic codes for us to be used as we see fit ... assuming we can afford the price. Resultant prototype hybrid warrior life-forms significantly superior to all older strains - though survival rate of individual forms is less than 1%, mitigating numbers to a fraction.\n\nThis is compensated, however, by the sheer power each individual Hybrid Warrior possesses. The term 'Immortal' is apt - for they indeed live up their names."
