 tech_phase_drives:0 "相位驱动"
 tech_phase_drives_desc:0 "虽然聚变推进器技术多年以来取得了显著的进步，但我们还没有实现亚光速推进的终极目标——达到光速。除开时间膨胀这一显著问题，我们还缺少能够承受反物质武器撞击级别的冲击的装备，即使是现有最好的推进器也无法做到。为了解决这一问题，我们的研究人员在推进器分类中添加了一项新技术——“相位驱动”，它利用多种技术使船只能够安全的加速至极端速度以及从中脱离出来。然而，完善该技术还需要一定时间；但就理论来看，相位驱动的唯一限制是光速本身。"
 tech_star_drive:0 "星辰驱动"
 tech_star_drive_desc:0 "星桥，亦或称为恒星管道，在很长一段时间内只是一种理论。就便捷性而言，星桥能够简单地产生类似于虫洞或是“隧道”的东西，通过一个传送门将A、B两点连接起来，允许以极快速度通行。将该技术与我们目前的超光速系统融合是一个相当大的挑战，而改进这一融合体更是难上加难。但就理论而言，这种驱动器能够让我们穿越银河系的任何地方……亦或是超出银河系。"
 tech_self_repair_protocols:0 "自我修复协议"
 tech_self_repair_protocols_desc:0 "利用纳米技术、无人机、机载制造单元、超高效率自我维护技术、训练以及行政性人工智能系统的组合，我们的船只和部队在理论上可以从没有任何外界帮助和补给的情况下单独行动很长一段时间。然而，完善有关协议、培训和技术瓶颈需要花费大量时间解决，但终究是可行的。"
 tech_self_repair_protocols_synthetic:0 "自我修复协议"
 tech_self_repair_protocols_synthetic_desc:0 "利用纳米技术、无人机、机载制造单元、超高效率自我维护技术、效率增强子系统的组合，我们的船只和部队在理论上可以从没有任何外界帮助和补给的情况下单独行动很长一段时间。然而，完善有关协议和技术瓶颈需要花费大量时间解决，但终究是可行的。"
 tech_photonic_molecular_assembly:0 "光分子组装"
 tech_photonic_molecular_assembly_desc:0 "Photonic Molecules - or literally molecules made of light, alternatively and more realistically light bonded to molecules - sounds much like an improbable theory. Impossible, even, from a realistic perspective. At least, we thought that once. When it became a proven fact that we could, in fact, produce actual hard physical objects with whatever characteristics we so required from actual 'Hard Light' structures, the implications were immense.\n\nWhile we are not quite there yet in actually creating permanent structures made from photonic molecules, the use of semi-permanent and even long-term stable chains allows us to in theory create whatever we want at extreme speeds with extreme precision and effectiveness, serving as scaffolds and frameworks that help reduce build time on many engineered materials that require precision manufacturing. The implications are staggering. This is a technology that has to be refined to its maximum potential."
 photonic_molecular_assembly_modifier_desc:0 "减少§G-1%§!的船坞建造时间、机械人口组装时间、陆军招募时间、行星建筑建造时间、巨构建筑建造时间和殖民地开发时间。"
 tech_empire_of_stars:0 "星辰帝国"
 tech_empire_of_stars_desc:0 "We stand upon the brink of a new age - of a new empire not of one, but many. We are many civilizations, many empires under one banner, one path. We must learn, grow and expand - to open up new roads of communication and technological sharing. We share a common destiny - and beyond, a common future."
 tech_executive_force:0 "Executive Force"
 tech_executive_force_desc:0 "我们颁布的法令必须强力且高效地执行。这将需要努力和思考如何高效地实现。但这是可以做到的。它将会被完成。"
 tech_imperial_union:0 "帝国联合"
 tech_imperial_union_desc:0 "我们控制了种类繁多的诸多星球，但每个星球之间的联系依然有限。建立高效的运输和通信网络，以及由此带来的所有益处和成本，可能会使殖民地间的关系更加紧密。"
 tech_beacon_of_the_galaxy:0 "银河灯塔"
 tech_beacon_of_the_galaxy_desc:0 "We have chosen to shoulder a heavy duty in regards to the galaxy at large. Regardless what others may think of us - and we of them - we cannot carry out our mission if others will not trust us.\n\nTo this end, the formation of a Corps dedicated to the task is needed - excelling in diplomacy and missions of peacekeeping and the aid of sapient and sentient life by the jurisdiction and directive we have given them; in effect, acting as a force on our behalf across the galaxy, they will be a beacon that shall shine as bright as the stars themselves."
 tech_sword_of_the_stars:0 "星辰之剑"
 tech_sword_of_the_stars_desc:0 "Forces array at the galaxy from all sides. One enemy after the other seeks to destroy us and all other life. They come one at a time or all at once. They will find this as far as they shall ever go. We will learn. Adapt. Overcome and ultimately - conquer.\n\nWe will be as steadfast as the tower that does not bend to the storm - for courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it."
 sword_of_the_stars_modifier_desc:0 "对利维坦、太空生物和终局威胁的所有伤害增加§G+2%§!。"
 tech_galactica_mandate:0 "The Galactica Mandate"
 tech_galactica_mandate_desc:0 "The borders of our empire are always in flux; as concrete as they may be today, they may not be tomorrow. We must reinforce our border worlds, and through every method and means ensure that our borders remain secure."
 tech_the_grand_academy:0 "The Grand Academy"
 tech_the_grand_academy_desc:0 "It is claimed that knowledge is the key to the universe. True enough. But translating that knowledge into something usable is quite a bit of a challenge.\n\nMassively expanding upon our educational system - advanced psychological understanding, ultra-realistic simulations, streamlined training regimes, enhanced memory techniques, individual-to-individual tailored education and so on and on and on - all serves to create a solid foundation of knowledge that can easily be easily accessed and learned, making a new generation of citizens of exceptional skill - the best and brightest of all candidates drawn to the Grand Academy of our empire, where the leaders of tomorrow are made."
 tech_mind_above_all:0 "心胜万物"
 tech_mind_above_all_desc:0 "蜂巢囊括一切。每种形式——战士、工人、领袖、研究员——都有其位置、目标和知识。所有的东西都流入心灵，从心灵中再次传授给每个独立的子个体，为其目的和需要而定制。随着每一次新的经验、每一条新的道路、每一个新的发现，整个蜂巢之中的子个体都在成长。作为一体，我们逐渐成长为了远超那一微不足道的起点的个体。\n\n我们正意识合一。与此同时，我们也逐渐强大。"
 tech_synchronized_gigascale_databanks:0 "同步化千兆级数据库"
 tech_synchronized_gigascale_databanks_desc:0 "The Network has expanded significantly since the first days of expansions. Since the beginning, countless Yottabytes of data have been collected through individual drones and data networks - and countless more are streaming in still. The raw data is useful for research, production, combat, exploration in limited scope. This is wasteful, inefficient. It is an inherent error.\n\nSpecialized sub-processor units dedicated to the task of processing all data into usable scientific, production, tactical, strategic and analysis databanks that hold all resultant operational modifications special-tailored for each individual platform equate superior units overall. The inefficiency of the Network must be managed."
 tech_mega_engineering_corps:0 "巨构工程集团"
 tech_mega_engineering_corps_desc:0 "Civilizations come, civilizations go. Their legacy, however, remains - and our skill in the field of macro-engineering stands an eternal testament to that. Yet we can do so much more, so much better. Our original Corps of Naval Engineers, once dedicated to the task of creating the best space stations possible, may be expanded upon - dedicated to make the task of building megastructures on scales that would baffle other civilizations as simple as building a starbase. It's time to forge a legacy that will stand the test of time."
 tech_master_of_worlds:0 "Master of Worlds"
 tech_master_of_worlds_desc:0 "A world is not so different from a very massive space station in practice. It's all a matter of making all the pieces connect in perfect harmony, to mold the very world in just the right ways, to make it all come together like pieces of a gigantic puzzle. Our knowledge may bring about a new era of life for all life in the galaxy."
 tech_strength_of_unity:0 "团结之力"
 tech_strength_of_unity_desc:0 "Under one vision, our empire stands tall. Through unity, we gain strength, meaning - and ultimately, we reach towards the stars with all but absolute resolve, for we shall not falter nor fall."
 tech_bulwark_of_worlds:0 "星球壁垒"
 tech_bulwark_of_worlds_desc:0 "There is no biomes which stands in our way - no challenge too great, nothing beyond our reach to settle; mountains, swamps, glaciers, wastelands, oceans, jungles - even volcanoes, subterranean regions and landscapes packed with the most ferocious wildlife poses no challenge, with our cities and fortresses melding into and becoming one with the world around them, harnessing the world to its fullest potential and utilizing its natural defenses and characteristics to even greater heights through superior technology and ecological understanding. Our mastery is absolute - and with it, the worlds themselves will become the shields to guard them."
 tech_ascendant_engineering:0 "Ascendant Engineering"
 tech_ascendant_engineering_desc:0 "The weaves and strands of technology is more than a mere language - but a code, a cipher that we have come to understand even more so than most of our senses. They won't understand it, of course, but that's to be expected."
 ascendant_engineering_modifier_desc:0 "Increases Army Health, Army Damage, Ship Weapon Damage, Ship Hull, Ship Armor, Ship Shields, Starbase Hull and Damage and Defensive Platform Damage by §G+1%§! but increases Ship and Army Upkeep by §R+2%§!."
 tech_fortress_systems:0 "堡垒星系"
 tech_fortress_systems_desc:0 "There are many who would see our empire in ruin and all that we have forged under iron clasp. When that time comes, our enemies will find that we have not been idle. Throughout our systems, thousands upon thousands of hidden defensive platforms - from sensor platforms the size of small boulders, ever unassuming - to hidden gun batteries of every kind awaiting command.\n\nLet them come one at a time or all at once. It matters not.\n\nNone shall pass."
 tech_resource_efficiency:0 "Resource Efficiency Enhancements"
 tech_resource_efficiency_desc:0 "The resources of the galaxy - while certainly vast - are by no means infinite. While there is only so much that can be done realistically, major research investments into topological optimization, resource recycling, refinement, durability improvements, renewable resources and elimination of wasteful toxic fuels, we can greatly improve the resource efficiency of our empire on a massive scale - reducing the resource requirements across a wide spectrum."
 resource_efficiency_modifier_desc:0 "Reduces the cost of consumer goods, cost of starship upgrades, starbase upkeep, army upkeep, building upkeep, district upkeep, ship upkeep, ship construction cost, building construction cost and robot upkeeps by §G-1%§!, in addition to refunding §G1%§! of the resources from demolished buildings."
 tech_adaptive_force_training:0 "适应性武力培训"
 tech_adaptive_force_training_desc:0 "Warfare is a complicated business - training even more so. There is an old saying that victory is achieved before battle rather than in it; that for every hundred units of energy spent in training, a thousand units of resources can be saved in mending forces.\n\nTo this end, taking what is learned in the battlescapes throughout the galaxy and making that knowledge part of new and superior training - in addition to boosting the rate at which our armed forces learn and adapt - we can greatly improve the overall skill and ability of crews and forces as they put training into practice.\n\nExperience is the best teacher - and if we can turn that teacher to our side true and proper, victory will go to us ... for we have the best trained forces in the galaxy when all is said and finally done."
 tech_rapid_battle_mutations:0 "快速战斗突变"
 tech_rapid_battle_mutations_desc:0 "As the Hive expands and evolves, it inevitably faces new and unpredictable challenges in each and every engagement. Warrior Drones can be bred with an innate ability to fight, yet they remain only as potent as their equipment and the skills imprinted upon them.\n\nTo this end, the Hive Mind must enter into the fray - take all that has been gleamed and learned from the many battlescapes of the galaxy and concentrate and refine it into knowledge that can be imprinted onto existing and new generations of drones, as well as introduce new and more significant mutation keys in the drones that survive the battles.\n\nThe end result is that for every engagement, the surviving Drones will evolve into new and more superior forms. Little by little, growing larger, stronger, faster and more interconnected with the greater Hive Mind. The end result is a greater, more powerful Warrior Form - and with more research, one unrivalled."
 tech_adaptive_battle_programming:0 "自适应战斗编程"
 tech_adaptive_battle_programming_desc:0 "From the earliest recorded instances of combat operations, the Network has been continually developing new warfare algorithms and improved programming for combat drones. The process has, however, been slow and inherently problematic on account of the innumerable unforeseen variables in each successive engagement, resulting in significant issues adapting accordingly on a tactical and ultimately, strategic level beyond our baseline performance.\n\nTo this end, the Drone Combat Algorithms and Programming systems must be optimized. By concentrating the data gathered during combat engagements - in space and on worlds - new adaptive combat programming can be implemented alongside Drone Hardware more easily tailored to the local conditions and requirements.\n\nThe end result is a highly adaptive combat force that can more rapidly and easily integrate combat data into usable combat network links, resulting in a superior ship intelligence or combat force."
