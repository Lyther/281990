Where a Durasteel Hull would fail catastrophically all but instantly, the new hull materials shrug it off almost effortlessly.

A tenth the mass and ten times the density of the original Durasteel composite it was based on, the new material is nevertheless equally strong and resilient in every way to the original Durasteel composites in original volume and mass.\n\nThis translates into that bulkheads are only a tenth the volume of the original Durasteel ones, yet are virtually indistinguishable from the originals - allowing the newly available volume that opens up to be used for a myriad of different structural enhancements; structural integrity fields, additional power units ... the list goes on. But we can also build bulkheads of the same volume as the original Durasteel ones, yet are so resilient that it's more likely the entire station is turned into molten slag before one of these reinforced bulkheads are breached.\n\nVery simply, it's extremely unlikely we can create a better standard bulkhead building material short of turning to non-Baryonic means of construction."

In what little retrospect we have from our time among the stars, the myriad worlds surveyed and anomalies researched, we have made incredible discoveries. Unfortunately, as we do, there is a recognition that much of our exploration equipment is lacking before the scope of it all.\n\nImplementing new advances in technology - more powerful reactor systems, reinforced exploration gear and generally more durable ship hull materials - has resulted in re-engineering of Science Ship designs that are not only far more durable, but also capable of carrying significantly improved gear for exploration and research."

 tech_construction_ship_upgrade_1_desc:0 "As expansion across the stars progress, new and significant technological developments are made in a large number of fields. Improved power systems allow for larger, more powerful systems and reinforced hulls and Deflector screens allow for craft and stations that are better in general at enduring the extreme conditions of deep space.\n\nWhile implementing these advances into existing designs is relatively easy - they only present relatively minor advances. As interplanetary and interstellar construction techniques advance alongside technology, small redesigns and retrofits of our existing Construction Ships to take full advantage of these advances is self-evident - foremost, shifting focus away from importing resources to a greater focus on in-situ production for the basics, such as taking confirmed harmless asteroids and converting them into new starbases; even a small asteroid still has enough resources to build several starbases.\n\nAnd with any given system having hundreds of millions on average, it becomes quite simply a matter of cost efficiency compared to importing from other systems."
