 tech_planetary_forum_normal:0 "Social Megahubs"
 tech_planetary_forum_normal_desc:0 "The Hypercomms Forum offered us many new possibilities, but with the increase in communication, there have been increasing needs to satisfy needs across our empire. At the same time, economic theorems suggest that a large scale project that acts as a focal point for socio-economic structures on the planet - in essence, a massive hub dedicated to satisfying the needs of our people - could offer major political, economic and social opportunities."
 building_planetary_forum_normal:0 "行星论坛"
 building_planetary_forum_normal_desc:0 "The Planetary Forum is a gigantic complex - in effect a megacity on its own - and is effectively speaking a place for whatever purposes we so need and desire. Amusement Parks with every form of attraction imaginable, gambling dens, holosim facilities, virtual combat arenas, gargantuan shrines and temples for prayers and meditation, art installations, museums, libraries, speaker halls, parade grounds, racing tracks and so on and on; all carefully engineered and adjusted to maximize their efficiency and effect, while ensuring they never interfere in a negative way with one another.\n\nWhatever is so required or needed, the Forum can provide."
 tech_planetary_forum_hive:0 "Planetary Mega-Hives"
 tech_planetary_forum_hive_desc:0 "It has been a long time since we first ascended to the stars. With each step, each new world, new challenges, new opportunities, new threats. As we expand, however, the Hive Mind's power becomes more problematic - while we exert the level of control we require to remain coherent, we lack the level of control we can require to become truly optimal. An idea has formed that might solve the issue."
 building_planetary_hive_core:0 "行星蜂巢核心"
 building_planetary_hive_core_desc:0 "The great Hive Core is a gigantic complex the size of a megacity. Bristling with specialized facilities and signal amplifiers, it is the single strongest link to the Hive Mind across the entirety of the planet - even the central administrative heart of the colony does not have the sheer potent link that it does.\n\nFrom here, specialized Drones act as a support for the Hive Mind, amplifying the link to and from, resulting in stronger, more coherent and efficient drones that move with an ease in their tasks that other worlds would struggle to achieve."
 tech_bastions_of_faith:0 "Bastions of Faith"
 tech_bastions_of_faith_desc:0 "In the many years since we first arose to the stars, we have come to learn much about the universe at large - ever faithful, we have found wonder and terror in equal measure. Now, however, our empire has come to grow to such a size and to such power, that we can and should arise to the occasion - to build monuments that will stand till the end of time itself; quiet testaments to our faith and our empire."
 building_temple_city:0 "Temple City"
 building_temple_city_desc:0 "The Grand Temple City is a colossal complex solely to our faith and to the might of our people. The size of an entire planetary nation, the city holds shrines as large as mountains, libraries of sacred texts so vast they may qualify as their own regions and shrines to glorious in stature that they pale mere art.\n\nWhile indeed enormous - a bit excessive, even one could possibly argue - the reality is that the Temple City is just that; a city in itself, with many comforts for all of faith seeking refuge.\n\nMore still, communication links back to the homeworld and to the many other Temple Cities scattered throughout the galaxy allow for vast and synchronized sermons, studies and communions of previously unheard of scale, bonding our empire together under the light of faith."
