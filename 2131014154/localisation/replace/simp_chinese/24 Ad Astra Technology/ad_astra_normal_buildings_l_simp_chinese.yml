Yet we have come to hit a fundamental issue that was in a way, unforeseen in our ventures: an optimized logistics network.\n\nSpecifically, the issue lies in that while off-world logistics are quite easily handled by the system starbase, on and off-world logistics are hampered by the fact that SSTO technology has specific limitations in terms of bulk transportation, meaning a lot of resources already processed end up in storage until they can be transported off-world.\n\nTogether with a proposal to enhance our near-core mining technology, engineers and logisticians have proposed an all-encompassing solution to these specific sets of problems in the form of a dedicated Mining and Logistics Facility - the Tectonic Foundry."

It will be difficult to pull off - but success equates virtually unlimited resources for billions of years to come."

Deep down, the Foundry extends down to mantle depths for extraction and further expansion - and high above, either around the local star or around nearby stars, the Foundry controls massive arrays of continent-sized satellites that draw energy and matter from the stars to gradually convert into a vast range of usable elements.\n\nTo further production to even greater heights, the core facilities of the Foundry - habitat facilities, manufacturing plants, hangars, law enforcement and military defence facilities in addition to research and development facilities - all coordinate to a lesser or greater extent the greater industrial network of the system, making the facility a key piece in the greater logistical network."

They call it the Planetary Citadel."

Yet in this pursuit, a fundamental issue has cropped up - specifically, how to create an effective defensive fortress for something as colossal as a Ringworld.\n\nThe Ringworld in itself is hard enough - a single segment having more usable territory than an entire planetary system combined which means far more territory to patrol and safeguard - but coordinating the entirety of the segment's defensive operations is an even greater challenge due to the scale involved.\n\nYet for all the challenges involved, there are also incredible opportunities. A Ringworld is enormous. What would be far too massive for any normal world to handle in terms of sheer scale becomes a joke in practice to even one segment's worth of space.\n\nOur engineers have started to think big.

 building_interstellar_communication_array:1 "星际通信阵列"
 building_interstellar_communication_array_desc:1 "A behemoth structure the size of a small mountain range near the capitol itself, the Interstellar Communication Array is an immense network of arcologies dedicated specifically to a singular task and one alone - to handle the sheer logistical, information and bureaucratic workload of the empire at large.\n\nAmidst the myriad arcologies, a network of libraries, offices, sub-offices, sub-sub-offices, sub-sub-sub-offices and sub-sub-sub-sub-offices form a labyrinthine maze in which untold numbers of bureaucrats and agents working for the Colonial Agency continually work to manage the titanic loads of data and communication - their struggle to maintain the necessary supply lines and logistics all but constant.\n\nStandard protocols for entering the Array involves sensory protection, up-to-date maps and for the deeper recesses potentially protective equipment and an experienced guide."
 building_interstellar_administrative_array:1 "星际管理阵列"
 building_interstellar_administrative_array_desc:1 "Towering high above the stratosphere of the Ecumenopolis below and narrowly touching the equivalent altitude of the mesosphere, the Interstellar Administrative Array is the focal point of the entire empire's administrative effort - its many data libraries, sub-layers of offices, too many to list, a constant buzz of activity that never ceases, handling data and logistics on a level that would require several pre-spaceflight worlds worth of bureaucrats to manage otherwise.\n\nTravel to, from and throughout the Array requires specialized gear and travel passes, sub-passes and planning - a single trip merely three levels up or down without proper requisitions and permits taking standard weeks under the best conditions, years at worst.\n\nNevertheless, if there is anywhere to find the right information or request the right permit, the Array is the place."
 building_galactic_administrative_array:1 "银河管理阵列"
 building_galactic_administrative_array_desc:1 "The size of an entire planetary continent, the Galactic Administrative Array is the penultimate expression of the sheer bureaucratic might of its empire. Artificial mountain ranges all together form the gargantuan Primary Offices and Primary Data Libraries of the greater Array, within their bounds untold millions of office complexes, communication facilities and habitat facilities.\n\nAt the core of it all is the Head Office with a communication antenna so colossal it could easily form its own pre-spaceflight nation, the Head Office itself so monumental it is best described as an entire self-contained nation with its own strange practices to maintain and curate the never-ending flow of incoming data to and from the capitol.\n\nTo traverse the Array is difficult even in theory - the sheer number of permits, sub-permits, sub-sub-permits and sub-sub-sub-permits so vast that that it effectively requires a literal army's worth of clerks and bureaucrats to achieve within a relatively reasonable timeframe of 48 standard years."
