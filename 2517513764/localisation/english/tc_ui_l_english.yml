 tc_ui_research_hint_main_text: "This is a brief guide, and more detailed guides will be gradually added later.\nThe way to conduct research is closer to tradition than technology. After accumulating enough knowledge fragment, click the button to get research.\nSelectable and researched buttons will have tooltips explaining the name and consumption of the research.\nThe research related to the production process is listed on the right. It is recommended to choose which research to select according to the progress of the game."
