 tc_taint_planet: "Weird planet"
 tc_taint_planet_desc: "The planet's surface is covered with bizarre purple vegetation, and remote scans of the planet indicate some kind of contamination......"
 tc_relic.3.name: "Oasis"
 tc_relic.3.desc: "Archaeological team found in the planet 17°10′ north latitude, 42°35′ east longitude there are close to 100 square kilometers covered with green plants similar to the normal vegetation. The scientific ship landed in this area, where a large number of shiny herbaceous plants appeared. A scientific commissioner pointed out that perhaps it is these plants with shiny petals that prevented the outside purple plants to grow inward."
 tc_relic.3.a: "It's quite beautiful, can you bring some back?"
 tc_relic.4.name: "Ruins"
 tc_relic.4.desc: "As the archaeological team moved toward the center of the Flower Sea, the scientific commissioners discovered a large number of fragments of ceramic instruments from an ancient civilization. Judging from their appearance, they appear to have been used to calcine and distill certain substances.\nWhat puzzled the scientific commissioners was that this ancient civilization did not seem to have developed into the age of electromagnetic theory, did they rely on steam engines to travel into space?"
 tc_relic.4.a: "Flying on steam engines? Does that make sense?"
 tc_relic.5.name: "Mysterious Spire"
 tc_relic.5.desc: "In the center of the Flowers Sea stood a spire built of purple stone bricks. What puzzled the science commissioner was that when they stepped on the stone brick floor near the spire, there seemed to be some mysterious force that made them act swifter.\nThe gate of the spire was decorated with gold, and the gate frame was carved with strange symbols, perhaps some kind of ancient writing. The gate is as strong as neutron armor, no matter what cutting tools can not even damage a trace. At this point, a science commissioner accidentally knocked over a clay pot, which contained a silver key. It appears to be the very key to the gate."
 tc_relic.5.a: "Find a way to disassemble the gate and load it onto the ship."
 tc_relic.6.name: "Mysterious Spire"
 tc_relic.6.desc: "The interior of the spire is surprisingly small, but everything is beyond the imagination of the scientific commissioner. Although the spire was airtight, its interior was unexpectedly bright - fires danced within the glass lamps on the walls, which seemed to have been burning for tens of thousands of years and would continue to do so.\nOn a table in the corner was a rotting wooden stick, its ends wrapped in iron metal, next to a yellowed piece of paper covered with traces of ink and blood, much of which had been covered beyond recognition. But it can still be assumed that the civilization's equipment went out of control and eventually contaminated the entire planet.\nAfter hours of \"searching blindly\", a commissioner found a stone button on the wall, and when he pressed it, the commissioner flew to the upper level of the spire as if unaffected by gravity."
 tc_relic.6.a: "A civilization that failed to even discover electromagnetic theory had mastered anti-gravity technology?"
 tc_relic.7.name: "Ancient Documents"
 tc_relic.7.desc: "On the upper level of the spire was only a chair, and on the chair sat a skeleton, who was wearing a robe made of a fiber material we had never seen before. In the compartment of his robe, the scientific commissioner found a book with a strange pattern on the cover, which, surprisingly, was still only slightly yellowed after so many years. On the title page of the book was written in some ancient language:\n§1Thaumonomicon——by Azanor§!"
 tc_relic.7.a: "Let us see what is written in this vintage book."

 tc_thaumic_disassembler_relic_event_set: "Thaum reaction"
 tc_thaumic_disassembler_relic_event_set_desc: "A response to an arcane device has been detected somewhere on the planet, and an archaeological project has been established"
 tc_relic.21.title: "Abandoned mine"
 tc_relic.21.desc: "Archaeologists found a cave at the source of the reaction, and some Warded Arcana was applied to the entrance, which caused conventional remote detection to be interfered and the place could not be found.\nAfter preliminary exploration, the archaeologists analyzed that this should be a mining facility, which is now abandoned."
 tc_relic.21.a: "See what can find in it."
 tc_relic.22.title: "Abandoned mine"
 tc_relic.22.desc: "During further exploration, the archaeologists found something wrong.Usually, mining facilities have large-scale excavation machinery. Even arcane civilizations should have similar things. However, no traces of large-scale machinery operations have been found here, and many passages are only With a width of three meters, it simply cannot accommodate the pass of large equipment."
 tc_relic.22.a: "too weird."
 tc_relic.23.title: "Abandoned mine"
 tc_relic.23.desc: "As the depth drops, the traces of manual excavation become more and more obvious, and the mine begins to fork. Archaeologists use detection devices to explore the direction of the mine and find that the mine forms a structure similar to fish bones.At the same time, an artificial cavity was found."
 tc_relic.23.a: "Rare mine structure, is there any reason for this?"
 tc_relic.24.title: "Cavity"
 tc_relic.24.desc: "The archaeologists went to the cave in the curved mine tunnel, and finally discovered that this was a place similar to a rest area.There were some unusable manual excavation tools in the remaining container.Is this mine excavated by manpower?\nA further search found a log, and the accompanying linguist had begun translation work."
 tc_relic.24.a: "Hope some valuable information."
 tc_relic.25.title: "Log"
 tc_relic.25.desc: "The log content is as follows:\n<Uninterpretable date record>\nMining is really troublesome. Arcane bore machines are very convenient and fast but they are too inflexible. I heard that the Mekanism Technology Group of <Unknown location> has a high-speed mining tool called §HAtomic Disassembler§!,Hope to observe it one day.\n……\n\n<Uninterpretable date record>\nThe performance of §HAtomic Disassembler§! is amazing, but the other party does not want to share this technology.But it doesn't matter, I have scanned it with a Thaumometer in secret, and now I only need to reproduce it in thaumic ways.\n……\n\n<Uninterpretable date record>\nFinally, using the §MThaumium§! and §MVoid Metal§! and Arcane Infusion processes, I successfully reproduced the function of §HAtomic Disassembler§!.It looks exactly like the Atomic Disassembler, except for the parts that have turned black due to the use of void metal.Although it lacks some insignificant functions, it has also gained the ability to repair itself. I named it §MThaumic Disassembler§!.\nI shared this invention with others, and it quickly became popular.\n……\n\n<Uninterpretable date record>\nDamn, what happened. Thaumic Disassemblers everywhere started spontaneously spontaneously damaged, and new ones could not be made.I don't understand what happened, but I used a time control arcane to create a static force field to save a §MThaumic Disassembler§! sample, I hope it can be preserved...\n\n\nThe archaeologists found a secret door following the location recorded in the log, and it seems that the Thaumic Disassembler was been preserved."
 tc_relic.25.a: "Let's see how amazing this tool is."

 tc_relic.30.title: "A giant...hourglass?"
 tc_relic.30.desc: "When the research ship enters the Tempus system, the first thing that is noticed is that there is a huge hourglass-shaped object in the system.But this is very unusual, the hourglass is a primitive timekeeping device that relies on gravity to work, and it should not work in a gravity-free environment."
 tc_relic.30.a: "That's weird, gotta look into it"

 tc_tempus_hourglass_project: "Research hourglass"
 tc_tempus_hourglass_project_DESC: "This strange space hourglass seems to have its own gravitational generator to make it work, but does that do anything? We need to take a closer look at the device."
 tc_relic.35.title: "Hourglass broken"
 tc_relic.35.desc: "The surface scans and tomography scans of the hourglass failed to find anything special, and the external structure was just some very common metal and crystal structures, and no gravitational device was found.\nIn the end, the only possibility was the unique properties of the 'sand' in the hourglass. The researcher decided to break the structure of the hourglass to try to study the internal matter. When the crystal shell was cut, something unexpected happened, and the research ship disappeared instantly."
 tc_relic.35.a: "what wha?"

 tc_tempus_relic_event_set: "§MMolten planet§!"
 tc_tempus_relic_event_set_desc: "Only this planet in the entire system has undergone significant changes, and some clues may be found on it."
 tc_relic.31.title: "building in lava sea"
 tc_relic.31.desc: "A scan of the planet's surface finds some kind of artificial structures in an lava ocean."
 tc_relic.31.a: "Who would build a building in a place like this?"
 tc_relic.32.title: "building in lava sea"
 tc_relic.32.desc: "There are no defensive devices or obstacles on the exterior of the building, as if others are welcome to visit, but it is obviously impossible to be so simple.Upon entering the gate, the expedition was presented with a lava promenade, but a broken but clearly passable road was left in the middle. This is strange, the purpose of the two designs seems to be contradictory."
 tc_relic.32.a: "Obviously it's a test, come on, Discovery team."
 tc_relic.32.b: "At first glance, it is a trap, arrange an airship, and break through directly."
 tc_relic.33.title: "lava corridor"
 tc_relic.33.desc: "The whole corridor is full of various mechanisms, such as cannons, visible but intangible holographic projections, rotating fire-breathing mechanisms, and pillars that sink into magma from time to time. However, these are very easy to crack in front of the explorers with advanced equipment. The team quickly approached the finish line."
 tc_relic.33.a: "How does it look like a parkour track?"
 tc_relic.34.title: "END"
 tc_relic.34.desc: "In the end, the expedition team came to the end of the passage, and the empty room was filled with various hourglass-shaped items, which looked like a miniature version of the space hourglass, and there was nothing special about it."
 tc_relic.34.a: "Bring back these hourglasses to study them carefully."
 tc_relic.34.b: "just this?"

 tc_tempus_hourglass_research_project: "Research hourglass"
 tc_tempus_hourglass_research_project_DESC: "These miniature hourglass may tell us why."

 tc_relic.36.title: "Sands of Time"
 tc_relic.36.desc: "Like the huge hourglass, nothing special was found in the outer structure. Due to previous experience, these hourglasses were arranged in a safer environment for cutting and successfully obtained the inner 'sand'. After analysis, these 'sand' It's actually a special kind of Salis Mundus that has the ability to distort or reverse time to a certain degree, fortunately, the science ship merely was teleported.\nOn the other hand, these Salis Mundus must be sealed by special crystals, otherwise they will volatilize, and if the container is violently destroyed, it will create a time gap with devastating effect, which has inspired researchers to create a destructive weapon idea.\nAt the end of the study, Tempus' observation post reported that the giant hourglass had reappeared, and that the lava planet had now transformed into a Gaia planet."
 tc_relic.36.a: "And such a good thing?"

 tc_relic.53.desc: "After careful inspection, no defenses were found around the gate, and the gate could be easily opened. Marines are preparing to investigate further."
 tc_relic.53.a: "Be careful, maybe it's a trap"
 tc_relic.54.title: "gallery"
 tc_relic.54.desc: "Behind the door is a long corridor. During the process of advancing, images of square people suddenly appeared on both sides, which made the Marines think it was an enemy attack. After consuming ammunition, they realized that it was just a holographic image. Fortunately, it did not cause much damage to the sites.\n\nThe video tells this information:\n\nTo be able to come here must have passed the challenge and possessed a superb level of summoner.\n\nFor a long time, thaumers have been keen on staffs, gauntlets, or other creations, and summoners like me who are keen on summoning familiars have been ignored.\n\nI thought that after discovering the secrets of space, the magic of the familiar, which can prevent me from personally stepping into dangerous environments, finally had a chance to flourish, but in the end everyone else chose to create a more powerful and sophisticated giant caster.\n\nGradually, even some Summoner Guild members chose to give up their familiars to join the mainstream.The genre of summoners seems to inevitably decline, I had to choose a galaxy to transform into the arena, hoping that someone will inherit this genre in the future.\n\nHowever, until we made up our minds to get out of here, no one had ever attempted the challenge.\n\nI'm guessing no one will see this footage either, but anyway, behind the door is your reward."
 tc_relic.54.a: "It's too long, I don't look at it, what about my treasure?"
 tc_relic.55.title: "Familiar"
 tc_relic.55.desc: "The door was in disrepair for a long time and it was difficult to open it, so the Marine Corps chose to directly blast the hole with explosives.\nAfter entering the room, the most conspicuous are two familiar samples in jars and research notes, and there are many other arcane records around.\nThe accompanying thaumer immediately analyzed the research notes, and according to a cursory inspection, this was a space weaponization scheme of a defensive familiar and an offensive familiar."
 tc_relic.55.a: "This must be useful"
 tc_relic.55.b: "It's just useless garbage"
