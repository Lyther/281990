 NAME_Noah_Ark_Home_Planet:0 "Gaia"
 origin_noah_ark.10.name:0 "To The Past"
 origin_noah_ark.10.desc_1:0 "At last, we did it, and the world destroyed by the flood is restored to a paradise in our memory!"
 origin_noah_ark.10.desc_2:0 "We transformed this flooded world into a Gaia World, as it appeared."
 origin_noah_ark.10.a:0 "This time, it's our turn to be another Noah."
 origin_noah_ark.10.b:0 "What secrets seem to be hidden on this planet."
 noah_ark_1_digsite:0 "From Paradise"
 noah_ark_1_digsite_desc:0 "The Noah's Arkship has crashed here.\n\nFor a long time, the wreckage of the ship has long been fused with the environment, and we are always familiar with its existence. But the myths passed from an ancestor generation has always been constantly reminding us that our original homeworld was a paradise, and that the ship came from heaven."
 origin_noah_ark.21.name:0 "Hidden Compartments"
 origin_noah_ark.21.desc:0 "We are familiar with the internal structure of the Noah ark ship, as we have lived here for hundreds of years. Even though we have long since left the ship's development civilization, the details of the ship's interior are still recorded in related documents.\n\nHowever, we do not seem to know enough, as in the process of re-exploration of the ship, we discovered a huge compartment hidden in the core area of the ship. Perhaps the changes in time have faded its disguise, and the compartment gates are unpreserved before us.\n\nHowever, the compartment contains a password, and we cannot find any clues about the compartment from the textbook."
 origin_noah_ark.21.a:0 "Prepare the deciphering team."
 origin_noah_ark.22.name:0 "Heritage Deposit"
 origin_noah_ark.22.desc:0 "After some deciphering, we have successfully opened the door, and the sight behind the door was astonished by the archaeological team.\n\nThe compartment is filled with various nutrient-rich life supports, but the nutrient fluids have long been decayed and all remains of the facility. These creatures seem to have been passengers of the ark ship but for some reason they have died when they didn't managed to reach the destination.\n\nThere seems to be other secrets in the compartment."
 origin_noah_ark.22.a:0 "Regrettable."
 origin_noah_ark.23.name:0 "called Noah"
 origin_noah_ark.23.desc:0 "Our archaeological team seems to have discovered the captain of the ship.\n\nBy deciphering the label on the nutritional facility, we can identify the crew's duty on the ship. Most of the passengers, including the captain, are the same species. We can reasonably speculate that this species is the builder of the ship, and the others are the rescue passengers.\n\nIf the ancient language passed through ancient times has no deviancy, this kind of species is called Noah, and they are the civilization that saves our race."
 origin_noah_ark.23.a:0 "Your respect is yours."
 origin_noah_ark.24.name:0 "direction of Heaven"
 origin_noah_ark.24.desc:0 "The secrets of the Noah's arkship have been fully understood by us.\n\nAccording to the ship's logs, we have learned what happened, which confirms the legends of our ancestors. We originally live in a paradise, but the gods were discontent with the crimes of creatures in the heavens, and took down the gods. The massive sky flooded the paradise in a moment, and killed all creatures.\n\nBut fortunately, the civilization named Noah made the ark ship prematurely, avoiding the flood. And they were not only limited to protecting themselves, but also took a lot of other creatures, including us. However, the journey of flight was too far, and most of the creatures died in the voyage, leaving us alone to reach the destination.\n\nBut the act of Noah is not meaningless, as we are still alive, we will live with the will of Noah. We have found the direction of the heavens - §Y[noah_ark_home_planet.GetName]§!, and we wish to restore her to a former heaven."
 origin_noah_ark.24.a:0 "Go to the Heavens!"
 noah_ark_2_digsite:0 "Beneath Heaven"
 noah_ark_2_digsite_desc:0 "We have restored this place to the former Elysium, but the secrets of the past lie hidden beneath the heavens."
 origin_noah_ark.31.name:0 "Sculptor Drawings"
 origin_noah_ark.31.desc:0 "We have found some mysterious murals in a hidden shrine. \n\nThe murals seem to tell a story: a group of primitive creatures lived on this land, where the gods landed their seats and given the primitive creatures intelligence. However, the primitive creatures did not but thank them for their attempt to resist, and as a result, the gods landed in a flood of punishment."
 origin_noah_ark.31.a:0 "Sounds like our past."
 origin_noah_ark.31.b:0 "This seems to be the past of this planet."
 origin_noah_ark.32.name:0 "Ancient altar"
 origin_noah_ark.32.desc:0 "Following the discovery of mysterious murals, we have found an ancient altar again.\n\nIt appears to have been used to worship the gods, and despite millennia of smoke and flooding, it still holds most of its structure, which may be related to advanced materials used by the altar's construction. According to the engraving around the altar, the archaeological team judge that the altar was built to honour the gods who bestowed their wisdom, and that there is more than one on the planet."
 origin_noah_ark.32.a:0 "How strange."
 origin_noah_ark.33.name:0 "War of the Gods"
 origin_noah_ark.33.desc:0 "Our archaeological team has recovered the ruins of the planet's largest altar based on engraving.\n\nThe altar was subjected to heavy damage, and the level of destruction turned out to be not completely because of the flood, and it was likely being attacked by some kind of large weapon. Under the remains of the deepest walls of the altar, our archaeological team found a chip, and although most of the data was damaged, we can still read the remaining information.\n\nThe chip seems to have recorded a long-term war, where the sky was crushed by the gods and two gods just erupted in a battle above the planet. The fierceness of this war was far beyond the imagination of primitive creatures, and for them, it is no different from the end of the world."
 origin_noah_ark.33.a:0 "Perhaps that's not a normal driver's license."
 origin_noah_ark.34.name:0 "Ragnarok"
 origin_noah_ark.34.desc:0 "Our archaeological team has managed to recover the data stored in some of the chips.\n\nThe final message from the chips revealed that the war ended with the gods of primitive creatures, while the other side settled the planet. However, the primitives worshipped and grateful for the original gods, even after their god was a strong enough, they stand firmly together with their gods and fought finally against the invaders even without hope of victory."
 origin_noah_ark.34.a:0 "What a reverent creature."
 origin_noah_ark.35.name:0 "Noah's Arkship"
 origin_noah_ark.35.desc:0 "All clues have been pieced together.\n\nBased on the current findings and historical documents about the past, we can infer such a conclusion: the civilization that built the 'Noah' ark ship was the god of enlightenment of primitive creatures on this planet. The noah civilization was in harmony with the primitive creatures in this euphoria, and the primitives offered advanced technologies, and the primitive creatures thanked themselves in their own way. However, this peaceful life was broken by the invaders civilization, and they had a higher technology and stronger fleet that overwhelmed all of the ships of Noah civilization in order to overwhelm all of the ships of Noah civilization and occupied all of the planets of Noah civilization. However, they experienced a relentless resistance from primitive creatures and the residue of Noah, so they decided to destroy this paradise directly with a Colossus weapon.\n\n The remnants of Noah civilization built several escape ships to escape their birth day, but their friendship with primitive creatures was strong, and they took them together to evacuate with primitive companions without risking overload. The firepower of the invaders was too powerful, and in the end only one ark ship successfully crossed the surrounding network, but the invaders used special weapons to intercept all hyperlanes across this galaxy, and the last ark ship had to be forced to hide on one of the planets in the system.\n\n This is the history of the Noah ark ship, which is the truth hidden beneath the heaven."
 origin_noah_ark.35.a:0 "We will also become gods of our own."
 origin_noah_ark.35.b:0 "Is our God another Noah?"
 origin_noah_ark.35.c:0 "We will always remember the gods of the past."
 origin_noah_ark.35.d:0 "Noah, a civilisation worth celebrating."
