 contract.1.name:0 "§M Day of the Ancient Covenant§!"
 contract.1.desc:0 "Long ago, our nation discovered a secret in the ancient book's dictionary: our ancient ancestors signed some sort of temporary §Y Pact§! with some mysterious being. According to the records, the date of the §Y Pact§! began to take effect is today.\n\nThe people of the entire empire were eagerly waiting for the day to arrive, but nothing seemed to happen. But soon, we discovered that all of the empire's citizens had a higher efficiency, such as production, scientific research, construction, and the ruler seemed to have miraculously possessed immortal abilities.\n\nWe firmly believe that this is all due to the §YCivics§! said in that ancient book, and can bring our empire to a bright future!"
 contract.1.a:0 "§RLong live the future of the Imperium!§!"
 contract.1.tooltip:0 "§RDon't do this.§!"
 contract.3.name:0 "§RThe Loop and the Cycle§!"
 contract.3.desc:0 "We have done it for fifty years.\n\nWe have been benefited from the infinite powers we have given from the §RThe End of the Cycle§!. We know that we will pay for it, or we believe this is the price we can endure, or we can find a way to avoid it.\n\nWe cannot afford it, we can avoid it.\n\nThe price we pay is all. In a moment - faster than we don't have time to react, not to prepare countermeasures - [Root.GetName]... no. A once-mighty colony, now only dead. A powerful fleet that once ran into the void now only remains of dead souls and wreckage. Everything is consumed by the Shroud.\n\nBut with a blink, everything has returned to the ground, as if time had fallen in an instant. A massive realm emerged from the black hole, and above our homeworld, a cluster of psionic energy has gradually converged into entities. The Loop and the Cycle are shouting each other with our hard-to-seen voices, as if two monsters were fighting for their hands. They are constantly approaching, killing each other with faster actions than we can tell, and we can't detect the passage of time.\n\nIt's not known if yesterday, today or tomorrow, the fight has ended silently, a labyrinth of psionic storms and whispers of a terrifying abyss.\n\nEverything is over, and the blessing the divine has given us our blessing and blessing is over, whether by the Loop, or by the Cycle."
