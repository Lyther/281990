 parallel_sky.1.desc:0 "We have finally reached for the galaxy, and another nation who has always sided with us has embrace the stars.\n\nHowever, we looked around, but we didn't find any ships from another nation in space. We can't help but doubt whether the message from another nation to fly space in the sky is true, but at this point they have sent a transmission request."
 parallel_sky.1.a:0 " communicate."
 parallel_sky.2.desc:0 "Where are you... where are you?\n\nOur exploration vessels searched the galaxy, but weren't able to detect any trace of your ships. I see, your claimed advancement into space was a tricky attempt, and you didn't develop the technology needed by space aircraft.\n\nThis time, our nation is ahead."
 parallel_sky.2.a:0 "Should I ask you this?"
 parallel_sky.3.desc:0 "You mean - you can't find our ships anymore?\n\nWhat a strange thing, is it that our star is not the same star?"
 parallel_sky.3.a:0 "We don't know the answer."
 parallel_sky.4.desc:0 "Wait, our scientists have submitted a very important report.\n\nThe report shows that, according to years of survey of the research team and the pictures taken by the probe ship, our scientists have made a surprising hypothesis: §RWe two civilizations are not on the same planet!§!\n\nIt is reasonable to believe that the planets we have inhabited by our two civilizations are exactly the same environment, and in fact, not the same planet, for some reason, causing our planets to be superimposed to a certain extent. We can reach another planet through the invisible overlapping part of the planet, but not in space.\n\nThis hypothesis can also explain significant differences between our two nations regarding the map of the borders for tens of thousands of years."
 parallel_sky.4.a:0 "Is this hypothesis reliable?"
 parallel_sky.5.desc:0 "The scientist presented with the report enjoyed great academic achievements and intellectual prestige in our country, and his theory should be highly convincing.\n\nAlthough we still need a lot of time to verify this theory, we need to accept it for now."

 parallel_sky.12.desc:0 "With the destruction of §Y[From.GetName]§!, the folded world returns to the right track, and the parallel stars are no longer  wrong.\n\nThe status of another planet, the future of another civilization, the reason for the folded world, the return of the parallel stars, are buried in the dust as the planet dies."

 parallel_sky.13.desc.2:0 "After we control the §Y[Root.GetName]§!, we have discovered something incredible.\n\nFirst, observations from space cannot be gleaned from the planet, and there are always some areas on the planet that are unclear.\nSecondly, there seems to be not only its original owners on the planet, but also a second masters, and it possesses sufficiently advanced technology.\nSecondly, another civilization obviously possesses the technology of space travel and can see ships in the stars from the planet, but we cannot detect the movements of their ships from space.\n\nNow, another civilization has sent us a transmission request."
 parallel_sky.13.a:0 "Good."

 parallel_sky.14.desc:0 "Greetings, the new masters of this planet - to be exactly yours' new masters."
 parallel_sky.14.a:0 "What does this mean?"
 parallel_sky.15.desc:0 "Actually, this planet was created by different planets from both worlds. We can reach another planet through the invisible re folding part of the planet, but not in space."
 parallel_sky.15.a:0 "That said, you are in another world?"
 parallel_sky.16.desc:0 "That's it. Because we have different stars, so if you try to conquer us alongside us, you can only rely on land, and it doesn't cause any threats to our empire. In the same way, we can only lose one colony at most if we try to attack you."
 parallel_sky.16.a:0 "Indeed."
 parallel_sky.17.desc:0 "So, I suggest that we have no interference with each other and enjoy this huge planet together. If you so wish, we can even come together together."
