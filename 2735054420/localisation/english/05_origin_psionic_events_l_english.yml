 psionic.1.desc:0 "We have come to the three dimensional worlds, and while not yet adaptable, we must plan for the future.\n\nAt first, it is to make more worlds habitable to us. We can transform worlds into habitable §YPsionic Worlds§! via Zro consumption and psionic input, but not all worlds are worthy of us to do so.\n\nBased on our investigation of the three dimensional worlds, the common §Y nine huge habitable worlds§!, the holy §Y$pc_gaia$§!, the evil §Y$pc_nuked$§!, the ancient §Y$pc_relic$§!, the magnificent §Y$pc_city$§!, and the dirty §Y$pc_hive$§! are our potential conversion targets."
 psionic.1.a:0 "What future shall we usher in?"
 psionic.11.name:0 "Shroud Visitor: §HPsionic Transmutation§!"
 psionic.11.desc:0 "Through the consumption and input of Zro, §Y[From.GetName]§! has been transformed into a psionic world suitable for our habitation.\n\nHowever, as our transformation technology is still un mature, the psionic wave on this world is constantly changing and is unable to predict its future intensity for the time being. Still, this world is still our ideal home. And perhaps in the future, can we have the ability to stabilize the psionic wave?"
 psionic.11.a:0 "Long live psionic!"
 psionic.111.name:0 "Shroud Visitors: §GStrange Wave§!"
 psionic.111.desc:0 "The confused psionic wave on §Y[Root.GetName]§! is gradually gone, and the Shroud Visitors can adapt well to the environment here.\n\nHowever, the psionic wave seems to be too weak, so the Shroud Visitors need a lot of effort to accurately feel the exact location of the wave, and we can't use the psionic wave in it. However, the psionic wave on §Y[Root.GetName]§! is still changing, and perhaps one day the psionic wave here will have the strength to please us."
 psionic.111.a:0 "What a wonderful psionic power."
 psionic.114.name:0 "Shroud Visitor: §RCatastrophe Paradigm§!"
 psionic.114.desc:0 "The chaotic psionic wave on §Y[Root.GetName]§! is becoming increasingly higher, so there is no way for us to control it for now. \n\nAccording to local officials, there seems to be multiple rifts leading straight into the Shroud, and there is a growing trend. The source of constant psionic energy is rolling from it, and any approaching Shroud visitors feel a strong discomfort, and as such we cannot repair these rifts for the time being. Perhaps the psionic wave on the planet will be continuously enhanced, eventually reaching a dangerous threshold and causing the entire planet to be consumed by the Shroud."
 psionic.114.a:0 "May our fellow Shroud bless us."

 psionic.115.name:0 "Shroud Visitor: §RPsionic Disaster§!"
 psionic.115.desc:0 "The chaotic psionic wave on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has finally reached its peak, and space nearby is also torn apart by psionic energy, creating countless massive Shroud rifts.\n\nThe constant creation and expansion of the Shroud rift has allowed all Shroud rifts together as a bloody mouth devours the entire planet and all life on the planet will no longer exist. Finally, only one sphere covered in completely in disorderly psionic wave is the Shroud."
 psionic.115.a:0 "Catastrophe inevitable."
 psionic.121.name:0 "Shroud Visitor: §GNormal§!"
 psionic.121.desc:0 "The faint psionic wave on §Y[Root.GetName]§! is enhanced when it is weakened and eventually stabilized in a modest intensity. \n\nAll Shroud Visitors can adapt well to the environment here, and the psionic wave's enough psionic energy can also help our spiritual exercises. Biological creatures living in it will be happy with this warm psionic wave and are more than happy to communicate and discuss with others."
 psionic.121.a:0 "A beautiful day."
 psionic.200.name:0 "Shroud Visitor: §GStability Stabilization§!"
 psionic.200.desc:0 "Through our efforts, the psionic wave on §Y[Root.GetName]§! has finally stabilized at a suitable intensity.\n\nAll Shroud Visitors can adapt well to the environment here, and the stable psionic wave in it can also help our spiritual exercises. Every living organism in it will be happy with this stable psionic wave, and will be more than happy to communicate and discuss with others."
 psionic.200.a:0 "Celebration begins!"
 psionic.301.name:0 "Shroud Visitor: §GThe Waves are Strong§!"
 psionic.301.desc:0 "Through our tireless efforts, the chaotic wave on §Y[Root.GetName]§! is finally no longer as disorderly as it is.\n\nRemarkably, the stabilized wave is extremely strong, far more powerful than our stable average wave, making almost all work doubles."
 psionic.301.a:0 "Bless the gods!"
 utopia.2600.desc.psionic:0 "Psionic powers have always gone by us since the dawn of our civilization. Although we have lost most of our psionic powers to flee the Shroud, we still have the potential to exercise psionic power.\n\nNow, we have finally exercised a day-to-day practice to gain psionic potential for some [Root.GetSpeciesName]  weight. Although only a very few of our species have awakened most of their psionic powers, their numbers have grown steadily for many years.\n\nWhether this is due to some kind of instantaneous growth shaft or because something we have ever existed in our genes triggered the psionic awakening, we do not know."

We have contacted each other again in the form of psionics."

 utopia.2655.desc.psionic:0 "Like the whispering whispers in the dark room, the Shroud calls us from within. The beginning of the time is a birthplace of pure psionics. All creatures that have been granted psionic abilities can be drawn from the Shroud, somehow, even subconsciously, siphoning energy from the Shroud.\n\nSince we ascended, we have been able to see the Shroud clearly. Some of these patterns are filled with vortex-like energies we know, but are very alien for many days. On the Shroud, there are... other existences. A psionic being, which gazes at us from the other side, sometimes with curiosity, and sometimes with malicious intent... sometimes with malicious intent.\n\nWe are still learning the extension of our newfound powers, but it is possible for us to communicate with these spirits, and we must communicate with them, which will require the common efforts of our most powerful psychics."

 psionic.4.desc:0 "After several days of sleepful psychics, the psychics in the gathering of the psychics finally opened a short passage to the Shroud.\n\nNow that we have established the initial psionic link again, we can communicate with the Shroud through the §HContacts§! menu. In order to establish meaningful connection to this realm and meet the presence inhabited it, we need to use a special psionic emitters to expand our psionic range, which will consume a huge amount of energy.\n\nBut this is just a temporary moment, one day, we will tear apart the Shroud and return to the Shroud."

 crisis.4145.psionic.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] will not be defeated. Our thirst for the §Hthe Shroud§! will never change.

 crisis.4150.psionic.desc:0 "As time passes, the fires of faith are spreading with un shaked determination among every [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Our borders expand, and the power we have invested so.\n\nWhen encountering other empires, we will give them two choices: either full loyalty or perish. Of course, this is the premise we will give them the choice.\n\nNevertheless, the [Root.GetName] continues to expand until the edges of the §Hthe Shroud§!!"
 crisis.4155.psionic.desc:0 "A drastic change is coming. The [Root.GetName] is already reaching our grand goal. Every [Root.GetSpeciesName] feels the desire for §Hthe Shroud§! to us.\n\nWe can still learn from our experiences, no, it should be our history - we learn from the history of conquering other psionic beings to conquer the history of our enemies and rule this chaotic galaxy.\n\nOf course, all the efforts that would dare to stand against us will be futile, even §Hthe Shroud§!!"
