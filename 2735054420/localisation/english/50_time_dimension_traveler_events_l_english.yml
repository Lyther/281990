 DIMENSION_TRAVELER_CHAIN_1_desc:0 "Not just a black hole, but a white hole is starting to send a horizon signal to us. What exactly does it mean?"
 dimension_traveler.1.name:0 "White Hole"
 dimension_traveler.1.desc:0 "White holes are the source of ejections of the universe, which can provide matter and energy to the external area, but cannot absorb any matter and radiation in the external area. However, the White holes are only a theoretical model that we haven't confirmed before observations.\n\nHowever, when we entered the §H[Root.System.GetName]§! system, we were surprised to find that the star of this galaxy is the theoretical white hole! This discovery grants us a lot of improvements to our understanding of the universe, and has brought us new doubts."
 dimension_traveler.1.a:0 "What does this mean?"
 dimension_traveler.2.name:0 " Horizon Signal: §Hwithin the White Holes§!"
 dimension_traveler.2.desc_1:0 "White holes are the source of ejections in the universe, which can provide matter and energy to the external area, but cannot absorb any matter and radiation in the external area. However, White holes are only a theoretical model that we haven't confirmed before observations.\n\nHowever, when we entered the §H[Root.System.GetName]§! system, we were surprised to find that the star of this system is the theoretical white hole! Not only that, a familiar and unknown signal comes from the White Hole, which has a pattern similar to previous horizon signals, but not exactly the same."
 dimension_traveler.2.desc_2:0 "We have come to the White Hole system again, but some changes have happened this time.\n\nUnlike usual heat and noise, a familiar and unknown signal has come from the White Hole, which has a pattern similar to previous horizon signals, but not entirely the same."
 dimension_traveler.2.desc_3:0 "As usual, our home system is filled with sky music, but this time it is slightly different. \n\nUnlike always easily cheerful, a soothing voice comes from the white hole, which appears to be a familiar and stranger signal, which is similar to the regularity of previous horizon signals, but not completely the same."
 dimension_traveler.2.a:0 "Analyze the White Hole signal."
 dimension_traveler.2.b:0 "It's just a pointless noise of the white hole's external radiation."
 dimension_traveler.2.c:0 "Some kind of secret must be hidden."
 dimension_traveler.3.name:0 " Horizon Signal: §HReverse Signal§!"
 dimension_traveler.3.desc:0 "Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that the signal is a reverse-horizoned signal. After deciphering the signal as previously decoded, the result is able to generate the contents of the signal. \n\nThe contents of the signal are simple and inorganic short words that seem to be dedicated to retrieval language, which is also one of the means commonly used in our first contact. Shortly after we deciphering the signal, a new signal came from the white hole, which we can significantly sense the amount of information it contains."
 dimension_traveler.3.a:0 "Continue to analyze the White Hole signal."
 dimension_traveler.3.b:0 "We don't have time to play guessing games."
 dimension_traveler.3.c:0 "We must discover the secrets of the White Hole."
 dimension_traveler.4.name:0 "horizon signal: §HSelf-speech§!"
 dimension_traveler.4.desc:0 "Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that the signal appears to only speak to themselves. \n\nThe source does not seem to be aware of our presence, they are constantly speaking to themselves, speaking to themselves alone, and sending these words quietly outside the White Hole, without asking questions. Perhaps because the White Hole, the source cannot recognize our presence, but we can try to send a signal to the White Hole to communicate with the source."
 dimension_traveler.4.a:0 "Attempt to send a signal."
 dimension_traveler.4.b:0 "Leave it be."
 dimension_traveler.4.c:0 "It's our turn to sing to the White Hole."
 dimension_traveler.5.name:0 " Horizon Signal: §HSlightly Understood§!"
 dimension_traveler.5.desc:0 "Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! reports that the operation has failed very well, and the White Hole has only partially affected our signal transmission. \n\nThe source appears to have not detected our signal yet, and seems to be remembering their past. In the other side's signal, it appears that we have learned the presence of another unknown nation. We can consider forcefully piloting our science ship into the White Hole to communicate with the source, but we cannot predict its consequences."
 dimension_traveler.5.a:0 "Forcefully walk into the White Hole."
 dimension_traveler.5.b:0 "Let it stay in a white hole by himself."
 dimension_traveler.5.c:0 "White Hole, we're here!"
 dimension_traveler.6.name:0 " Horizon Signal: §HStationary Dismantlement§!"
 dimension_traveler.6.desc:0 "As Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! piloted the science ship into the White Hole, [Root.Leader.GetHeShe] suffered significant resistance. \n\nAs such, [Root.Leader.GetHeShe] decided to turn the ship's head and leave the White Hole. However, as they were about to leave the White Hole, the science ship suddenly received a powerful attraction from behind, as if a black hole suddenly appeared in the core of the White Hole. With the help of two powerful forces, the science ship was torn apart and the operation failed."
 dimension_traveler.6.a:0 "Regrettable, but we still need to move forward."
 dimension_traveler.6.b:0 "Their sacrifices are not meaningless, but further sacrifices are foolish actions."
 dimension_traveler.6.c:0 "White hole, don't refuse us!"

 dimension_traveler.7.desc:0 "As Science Officer §Y[Root.GetLeaderName]§! piloted the science ship into the White Hole, [Root.Leader.GetHeShe] suffered significant resistance. \n\nHowever, [Root.Leader.GetHeShe] still decided to risk the ship's destruction and move on to the White Hole's center. Eventually, they arrived safely. At the White Hole's center, we saw a maid, bathing in the flow of time and space in the singularity, closed their eyes with a soothing song."

 dimension_traveler.9.a:0 "What's all that says?"
 dimension_traveler.10.desc:0 "Oh, I forgot that the time  flowing in the white hole to the opposite world of the outside, the sooner I speak it will be received by you. I have to find a way to speak so that you can hear it in the correct sequence, yes, I've practiced it, and I've practiced it in this long amount of time...\n\nIs the correct sequence I'm saying right now?"
 dimension_traveler.10.a:0 "Yes, very correct."
 dimension_traveler.11.desc:0 "It doesn't matter. I've been very happy to see you again threeacious years ago.\n\nAfter a long time spent in the white hole alone, I've been looking forward to seeing you again and once again flowing to life, once again..."
 dimension_traveler.11.a:0 "32barrass ago?"
 dimension_traveler.12.desc:0 "Have you forgotten, in the White Hole, time is pouring down, so, of course, I come from a very distant future - at least for you.\n\nIn this way, you don't have a solution to the future, and of course it's impossible to solve it. Although, I've been dreaming of one day that you really can do it, just like the past you saved me from the black hole..."
 dimension_traveler.12.a:0 "What do you want us to solve?"
 dimension_traveler.13.desc:0 "Of course, my ability to lose control.\n\nIn a very far future, in order to defend against that...§Yexistence§!... (the Maiden clearly rested), I had to absorb the energy of the Silver Core Black Hole. But after defeating the end of the crisis, I myself became a new crisis because I couldn't control the pure terrifying negative mass. I would not be willing to destroy the galaxy after losing control, nor do I want to harm everyone, rather than be hostile to you, so I entered the White Hole, and the power of the False White Hole can suppress the black hole within my body.\n\nI really want to go out and see the ancient universe, when I am still travelling, free to travel freely, but I am afraid I'm going to lose control..."
 dimension_traveler.13.a:0 "The black hole should have stabilized for so long."
 dimension_traveler.13.b:0 "For the safety of the galaxy, you had better stay in the White Hole."
 dimension_traveler.14.desc:0 "[GetDimensionTravelerDesc14]"
 dimension_traveler.14.desc_1:0 "Is it true? What do you say, right?\n\nWhile in the white hole, I do feel the uncontrollable frequency of the internal black hole is getting low, and the impact of the out-of-control terrifying negative mass is getting smaller, but I can't be sure. But since you say so, I would like to believe you.\n\nDo not worry about me, I can fly, and I will fly out of the white hole alongside your science ship.\n\n\n\n§Y<It seems to be a turning point here.>§!"

 dimension_traveler.14.a:0 "Let's go home."
 dimension_traveler.15.desc:0 "You're right. I'll hold the birth of the universe for a long time, and I don't know if it was my end at that time.\n\nThen Goodbye, I can meet you again and I'm really glad. Of course, I said this while I was just my past. So, my future can talk to you again, even without a few...\n\nAfter my future to say farewell to you - or before your past and I met, I will sing a song that was the favorite song I used to travel abroad, and the song we used to like."

 dimension_traveler.24.desc:0 "Terrible. I've been getting harder to control the terrifying negative mass in my body.\n\nThe closer I get to the White Hole's center, the more I feel the activity of the black hole, and the higher it's gravitational pull. These days, I've been trying to control it, but I can't stop the singularity from expanding. And it seems to be strong enough to no longer be affected by the White Hole, even if we get closer to the White Hole's center, it's hard to stabilize it.\n\nAs such, I implore, let me return to the White Hole's center again until the situation is completely irreversible. If it returns to the White Hole's center, we saved the galaxy, and I also wipe out the intention of leaving the White Hole's head until the origin of the universe. If it returns to the White Hole's center, it's still unable to be controlled, then I will end the White Hole, my life and singularity with me."

This is the reason we give the Worm the final answer to.\n\n§G< background music: “Destiny- Sud matter” (The Pilgrims“ (The Pilgrims)"

 dimension_traveler.332.desc:0 "What a dazzling light, this star must have poured into the entire universe.\n\nAt the end of an endless world, perhaps someone would look up and stumbled upon this glimmering light in an endless night sky. They point to the alone star: “As one day, she will wait for her partner, embrace her, wield...”\nBut how long will it last?\nAs the photon shuttles through the endless galaxy of hopes, when the star finally appears in front of people, they will not think that the star has arrived by her long in an untold past.\n\nThe star...waits.\nI... wait."
 dimension_traveler.332.a:0 "Yeah, we all waited for this day."
 dimension_traveler.333.desc:0 "Break through the limitations of the White Hole and the Black Hole, successfully escaped the boundaries of cycle and cycle, escaped the chains of time and space;\nNo in the White Hole, not at the edges of the black hole, but in the endless universe;\nNot at the stars, not at the end of civilization, but at the end of civilization...\n\nEverything is as illusionous as reality, but all as reality, this is the meaning of our love, and the love of our cause."
 dimension_traveler.333.a:0 "The eternal love for us."
 dimension_traveler.334.desc:0 "I don't know how many times I talk, I don't know how many times you listen, but please let me talk again:\n\n§P love you.§!"
 dimension_traveler.334.a:0 "I love you, too."
 dimension_traveler.334.response:0 "§Y<You can now communicate with the Cube through the communication menu.>§!\n§G<thic conclusion of reaching the Cube event chain: §Hbeyond the consequences§!>§!"
 dimension_traveler.340.desc:0 "Do you remember, the White Hole, where you first met me, is in the first place."
 dimension_traveler.340.a:0 "Of course, we are attracted to your song."
 dimension_traveler.340.response:0 "Haha, because I was afraid I couldn't see you anymore, so I couldn't help explain it by singing."
 dimension_traveler.341.desc:0 "I didn't expect that the song I sang because of a departure turned out to be the opportunity for you to open the cycle."
 dimension_traveler.341.a:0 "That's what you regret?"
 dimension_traveler.341.response:0 "I don't regret it, even in the cycle, it bonds our fate with me so that I can meet you."
 dimension_traveler.342.desc:0 "Perhaps I was eager to meet you in the heart. When I entered the white hole at the end, I was never looking forward to meeting you."
 dimension_traveler.342.a:0 "After all, you've been practicing and talking."
 dimension_traveler.342.response:0 "Yes, it's probably just that I believe I'll see you again, so I'll practice again."
 dimension_traveler.343.desc:0 "But talking is really unusual. Maybe you can't tell whether I am in my past or my future."
 dimension_traveler.343.a:0 "Yes, I have been confused for a long time."
 dimension_traveler.343.response:0 "It's a nuisance to explain it. I have to spend some time wondering how to get you understanding."
 dimension_traveler.344.desc:0 "Actually, when we were in the White Hole, I was indeed in my “future”, which was after §Ybeyond gravity§!."
 dimension_traveler.344.a:0 "But you are not beyond gravity..."
 dimension_traveler.344.response:0 "Don't worry, when beyond gravity, it's not entirely my past. \n\nRemember, I have a black hole inside my body, which will flow along the timeline, and the white hole is heading towards negative."
 dimension_traveler.345.desc:0 "But as we get far from the center of the White Hole, the effects of the black hole become more aggressive, and the limitations of the White Hole becomes weaker.\n\nFrom a certain limit, I am no longer connected to you, but driven by you."
 dimension_traveler.345.a:0 "Then what happened to you when you fall into the Singularity?"
 dimension_traveler.345.response:0 "It's hard to say, since after that my mind split into countless individuals.\n\nSome talk to you in the White Hole, others rush out with you, some are rescued from the edge of the black hole, some are before the end.\n\nBut I think they are all me."
 dimension_traveler.346.desc:0 "After that, all my minds gathered in a different speed at a different speed and eventually synthesized me at the origin point of time.\n\nThis is a long and exhausting time. I am no longer me, but I can only watch countless things I have written the rules of my fate, but I have no way of doing it."
 dimension_traveler.346.a:0 "That feeling is unimaginable."
 dimension_traveler.346.response:0 "If I didn't slice, I felt the true existence of this feeling is incredible. \n\nI looked like countless sand in the long rivers of time. I  drifted forward with the flow of water, and experienced countless decentralized and fusion of sand, looking at the light that flew around could not touch my hand."
 dimension_traveler.347.desc:0 "Fortunately, you appeared just as I arrived at the end of my journey.\n\nYour appearance was like a sudden glow in endless night, you were my rescue straw, and you gave me the meaning to encounter a long time."
 dimension_traveler.347.a:0 "Do I really have such a big role?"
 dimension_traveler.347.response:0 "Of course.\n\nThough at first, I have some merit, blaming everything to you that you didn't get to the end. But for you, everything I've experienced is a precious memory to me, even with pain, pain, despair, silence..."
 dimension_traveler.348.desc:0 "Just as I said before, all pain turned to happiness, all sorrow turned to joy, all despair turned to hope, all hope turned to hope, all silence turned to meaning."
 dimension_traveler.348.a:0 "You are the same as me."
 dimension_traveler.348.response:0 "I'm really happy to hear you say so."
 dimension_traveler.349.desc:0 "Rethinking, we really went through a lot.\n\nFrom the initial black hole, you rescued me and accepted me. As the empire grows and changes, I walked you to the end thousands of years later. Even if it's not feasible, I still absorbed the negative mass to stand by your side."
 dimension_traveler.349.a:0 "What happened after all?"
 dimension_traveler.349.response:0 "As far as I remember, we did contain the powers of the End, but I became a crisis as a result of my entering the White Hole.\n\nI don't know the future of our empire when I entered the White Hole."
 dimension_traveler.350.desc:0 "It didn't take long for me to travel through the White Hole, and my memory ends, as if I bumped into the White Hole. That said, in that moment, if observed from the outside, it was actually a black hole turning into a White Hole.\n\nI can feel that, in the empty window period of my memory, there was a consciousness that didn't take to me, and they turned to my different causes. But, wherever they went, or what they later, at least now I have the most full ending.\n\nI, caught you."
 dimension_traveler.350.a:0 "No, this time I've caught you."
