Investigations into the exterior of the building have failed, and the camera recording equipment will disappear at midnight and nobody can observe the hotel's disappearance in a state of awakening.\n\nWe must enter the hotel if we want to learn the secrets behind the building."

 time_hotel.0.desc:0 "According to the reports of multiple transport ships shuttleed in the §Y[time_ hotel_site.System.GetName]§! system, there were always crews sight of the ancient buildings that appeared in §Y[time_ hotel_site.GetName]§!, but when they approached they found that there was nothing on these asteroids. \n\nA few two reports could have been accidental, but a third and constant report means there must have been some kind of anomaly here."

 time_hotel.0.b:0 "It's just a coastal bunker in the universe."
 time_hotel.9.name:0 "The Open Hotel for midnight"
 time_hotel.9.desc:0 "After a careful investigation, we have finally found out that there is indeed an ancient ancient building on §Y[time_ hotel_site.GetName]§!. \n\nFor unknown reasons, this huge building will only appear for some time, in exchange for the time of our homeworld being midnight. According to the signs and patterns of the outer layers of the building, Science Officer §Y[FromFrom.GetLeaderName]§! speculates that this should be a hotel for the rest of the galaxy."
 time_hotel.9.a:0 "There must be some mystery in this hotel that we don't know."

 time_hotel.10.desc:0 "After investigation, we have not found any strange objects on §Y[time_ hotel_site.GetName]§!. \n\nPrevious sightings of ancient buildings could be collective illusions caused by prolonged space travel, or electromagnetic radiation caused by cycles in the galaxy. But anyway, we have come to the conclusion that there is no anomaly on the asteroid."

 time_hotel.1.name:0 "One Level of the Hotel"
 time_hotel.1.desc:0 "After the archaeological team entered the hotel, they experienced a very strange feeling.\n\nAfter a period of exploration, they finally realized that the movement of everything in the hotel changed quickly, or rather, the archaeological team felt the speed of time. However, the archaeological team was surprised to find that the interior structure of the hotel was very complete, the walls, floor was clean with no stain, and even fresh food was inside the storage room, as if the hotel was still running. Not only that, the archaeological team also found rooms resembling classrooms, and it seems that the hotel was also responsible for the education of children.\n\nIt seems that the archaeological team found a passage to the second floor, but due to the in adaption to time senses, the exploration speed was very slow."
 time_hotel.1.a:0 "Curious."
 time_hotel.2.name:0 "The Two Levels of the Hotel"
 time_hotel.2.desc:0 "After a long exploration, the archaeological team has finally found the way to the second floor.\n\nUnlike the two layers of the hotel, the time flowing speed seems to be low, but it is unlikely that the archaeological team has gradually adapted to the possibility of traveling to the second floor. The two layers of the labyrinth seem to be different from the one, and the environment seems to be in a corner of the city. In the small streets of the city, various  paints of deviancy and filth are visible everywhere on the wall, and piles of garbage and smoke on the ground are different from the one. The archaeological team suspects that this layer is a building dedicated to the habitation of bad elements who wandered into the stars.\n\nThe exploration of the archaeological team continues, and they report that they are heading for the three layers of the hotel."
 time_hotel.2.a:0 "Unimaginable scenarios."
 time_hotel.3.name:0 "Hotel Triple Layers"
 time_hotel.3.desc:0 "The archaeology team successfully reached the three levels of the hotel.\n\nThis time, the archaeology team noticed a slow change in time and was even almost near normal experience. But when the archaeology team tried to contact the archaeologists outside the hotel, they found that their sense of time still differs from the outside world, and the day outside world may be several weeks, or even months. The same is also shocking that the three layers of the hotel were law enforcement and judge agencies, overthrowing previous speculation on the negative elements of interstellar beings.\n\nIn the borders of both the two and three levels are law enforcement agencies, including prison chambers, black rooms, black rooms, and other functioning buildings. This is the interior of a massive Tribunal, where the tall judge  seats on the side, the guardians and debate stood on both sides, and a accompanying chambers surrounding the Tribunal with a strong sense of oppression, and the whole Tribunal is full of divine justice.\n\nThe archaeology team is eager to reach the four levels and leave here."
 time_hotel.3.a:0 "Respectful."
 time_hotel.4.name:0 "Hotel Stratum"
 time_hotel.4.desc:0 "The archaeologists hurried to the four levels of the hotel, revealed that the archaeologist §Y[time_ hotel_leader.GetName]§! has vanished mysteriously. \n\nNo known archaeologists were suddenly disappearing in the process of taking the four levels or gone earlier in the exploration of the three ones, and the archaeologists have gone unnoticed. The four levels - or what was once thought to be the building of the hotel - were a prison of a prison of galactic denseness - was nothing but a single prisoner in the prison. The archaeologists feel severe discomfort in this grim prison and are firmly confident that time passes far slower than usual, and are firmly denying the possibility of an illusion. \n\nThe archaeologists are unwilling to continue exploring the prison, or are willing to look for the missing archaeologists, and now just want to leave."

 time_hotel.5.name:0 "Ten floors of the hotel"
 time_hotel.5.desc:0 "The archaeological team didn't find a return exit, but accidentally stumbled upon a gate leading to the five levels.\n\nHowever, as they were eagerly opened the door, they fell into utter despair - behind it was another prison. The five levels were more grim than the four layers, and the archaeological team also reacted to them “doing the same day” in it. They madly beg for us to abandon the archaeological operation, as sending rescue ships to destroy the massive hotel and rescue them from the prison. However, the hotel still appeared while it was still hidden, and our dismantlement work was hard, and the structural integrity of the hotel was far beyond our expectations.\n\nIt seems that the archaeological team can only escape from the hotel by their own efforts."
 time_hotel.5.a:0 "Disappointing."
 time_hotel.6.name:0 "Hotel Six Layers"
 time_hotel.6.desc:0 "The archaeology team finally escaped the hotel through their strength, but they appeared on another asteroid far away from §Y[time_ hotel_site.GetName]§!. \n\nAccording to their memory, the archaeology team reached the six levels in panic and turned into deep illusions. They felt that they were dozens of years old and no longer a member of the other archaeologists, but were responsible for their own mistakes. They fought tears and shouted at each other, telling each other about their feelings and blaming their own mistakes. When they woke up from the illusion, they found themselves still in the hotel, and the six levels were filled with lush plains. As they were alive, the archaeologists worked hard to find the exit of the hotel. After passing through the exit, they appeared on other asteroids. \n\nThe archaeology team finally managed to escape the hotel, but we still don't know the secrets and whereabouts of the missing archaeologist."
 time_hotel.6.a:0 "There is still a mystery that hasn't been unsolved."

 time_hotel.7.desc:0 "After years of searching and waiting, the archaeologist §Y[time_ hotel_leader.GetName]§! has finally appeared. \n\nJust like the previous archaeology team, [time_ hotel_leader.GetHeShe] experienced the same encounter in the hotel and appeared on another asteroid away from §Y[time_ hotel_site.GetName]§!. However, the archaeologist seemed to have been decades old and claimed that it was a few decades ago that they could not remember the details. However, the archaeologist §Y[time_ hotel_leader.GetName]§! was not a static light in the hotel, and after awakening from the initial panic, [time_ hotel_leader.GetHeShe] detailedly surveyed the hotel all over, studying the device and facilities in the core area of the hotel, and finally came to a conclusion - it wasn't a hotel, but a time prison. \n\nSubsequently, [time_ hotel_leader.GetHeShe] sent a self-inflicted self-inflicted on somewhere in the prison."
