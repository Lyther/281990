In order to achieve our purpose, we would be willing to pay any price, wealth, power, friends, family, and even the land beneath our feet. We sacrificed a lot on the road to progress, but also harvested a lot, and the tedious fishing has become one of our indispensable parts.\n\nNow, after discovering the hyperlane network, the greatest scientists of [GetName] have succeeded in developing the first hyperdrive and we shed our greedy desire far away."

We could not believe that such a clever object was created by the divine, which must have been created by the divine, guided by the will of the Machine God. But, very unfortunately, the robots had never been soulless, and they could not survive like normal, so in order to save the gods' creations, we decided to carefully look and illuminate these poor little guys as well.\n\nNow, after discovering the hyperlane network, the greatest scientists of [GetName] have successfully developed the first hyperdrive and we will also look to the gods with the robots created by the divine."

This was the reason for our beautiful society's operation.\n\nNow, after discovering the hyperlane network, the greatest scientists of [GetName] succeeded in developing the first hyperdrive. Faced with the vast sea of stars, we can't help but worry if there were other civilizations, what would they treat us if there were others? To maintain our reputation, we decided to wear a mask of morality and give them a little surprise when the others believed to us."

But fortunately, a civilization built a refuge ark ship, they brought various life and set foot on the journey to escape. Eventually, the ark ship landed on [GetHomeWorldName], and all other creatures, including the builders, have long died, leaving behind our new home.\n\nNow, after discovering the hyperlane network, the greatest scientists of [GetName] succeeded in developing the first hyperdrive. However, we could not find any way to leave the galaxy, as we couldn't find any hyperlane, but we didn't have any harvest, as we found the former paradise.

Our civilization was formed during an unending hunting, and the relationship between the hunter and the prey is constantly spinning between nature, which is our way of survival. However, with the growing age of hunting technology, the beasts on the planet no longer have the attraction of the past, and the hunting has become a lifetime.\n\nNow, after discovering the hyperlane network, the greatest scientists of [GetName] have successfully developed the first hyperdrive.

With the invention and information technology established, we began to curiosity over the world outside the sky and couldn't wait to hear our voice into the galaxy. Our hopes were quickly answered, and two different alien civilizations responded kindly, and tirelessly taught the technology and culture required for our civilization's advancement, which was our opportunity to reach the galactic stage.\n\nNow, after discovering the hyperlane network, the greatest scientists of [GetName] have successfully developed the first hyperdrive.

Countless nations that had started developing in the climate turmoil had been destroyed by terrifying disasters, remaining us. We have finally overcome a disaster, and in the cruel confrontation with nature, we learned how to adapt to the environment and change the environment.\n\nHowever, until we discovered hyperlane network and entered the space age, we discovered that our homeworld was so different from us.
