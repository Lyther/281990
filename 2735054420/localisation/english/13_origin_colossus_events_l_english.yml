 ORIGIN_COLOSSUS_CHAIN_title:0 "Sword of Hanging"
 ORIGIN_COLOSSUS_CHAIN_desc:0 "We are deeply confused by the massive object, and the secrets behind it may take a long time to excavate. But the ahead is a long way, and in the journeys of the galaxy we still have enough time to explore the truth. It will also accompany us quietly, waiting for the unknowable future."
 origin_colossus.0.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HEternal§!"
 origin_colossus.0.desc_1:0 "The §YSword of the Hangar§! has been destroyed, and we can no longer know the truth behind it."
 origin_colossus.0.desc_2:0 "The §YRing of the Loop§! is destroyed, and we can no longer know the truth behind it."
 origin_colossus.0.a:0 "Farewell."
 origin_colossus.1.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HBasic§!"
 origin_colossus.1.desc:0 "With the development of technology, we have finally had a chance to get in touch with the big guys above §Y[Root.Capital_scope.GetName]§!. \n\nIt appears to be an advanced ship, but its energy seems to have depleted for a long time, with no signs of running anymore. The mystery is deeper, we don't know its origin or its purpose, nor what should we do about it."
 origin_colossus.1.a:0 "Start the investigation project immediately."
 origin_colossus.2.name:0 "Sword of the Hangar: §HRelic Ship§!"
 origin_colossus.2.desc:0 "After a long-term survey, we can be certain that the ship has been completely abandoned.\n\nThe results of the contact test show that there is no self-defense mechanism or self-defense mechanism of the ship has failed, so our survey team can try to enter the ship's interior for in-depth exploration."
 origin_colossus.2.a:0 "Investigate deeper."
 origin_colossus.3.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HEnergy Depleted§!"
 origin_colossus.3.desc:0 "According to the feedback from the survey team, the ship's energy source has been depleted, perhaps the reason why it hovered above §Y[Root.Capital_scope.GetName]§!. \n\nThe survey team stated that the ship was once equipped with a variety of advanced weaponry, but it has been wiped out for a long time. The only thing that is well preserved is a massive launcher, which appears to not be used in combat, but directly to the planet below. \n\nWe can try to transport it energy to launch the ship, but we can't guarantee it won't attack us."
 origin_colossus.3.a:0 "Provide energy."
 origin_colossus.3.b:0 "Hold on for now."
 origin_colossus.4.name:0 "Sword of the Ascendancy: §HUncertained§!"
 origin_colossus.4.desc:0 "We shall provide energy to §Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§!?"
 origin_colossus.5.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §Huseful to me§!"
 origin_colossus.5.desc:0 "The powering operation of the Fallen ships went smoothly. The AI of the ship did not show any hostility to us, and many of the remaining equipment on the ship has been restored.\n\nIn addition, the survey team found that the massive launcher seems to have the ability to destroy planets, which will greatly deter other spacefaring civilizations. We could use this ship to destroy any planet blocking us, or subjugate everything that would hinder our empire by conquering it.\n\nUnfortunately, the ship originally carrys many high-tech weaponry, but we do not have the ability to repair them. Perhaps we can restore the Sword of the Hangar afterwards."
 origin_colossus.5.a:0 "Impressive."
 origin_colossus.5.b:0 "I don't know if money is a disaster."
 origin_colossus.10.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HGhosts§!"
 origin_colossus.10.desc:0 "Sighted reports of multiple unknown creatures have appeared on §Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§!. \n\nIt is said that the crews frequently heard whispers of an unknown creature coming out of the room, but pushed it opens nothing. Moreover, some of the crews found that some kind of mysterious creature was approaching alone, but when glowing with light, the creature disappeared without a trace. \n\nSome of the crew believed it to be the Ghost, but the scientists believed it to be an illusion to the crew. However, before investigating the 'ghost' fully understood, the sword of the top may not work properly."
 origin_colossus.10.a:0 "Find out the truth of the Ghost immediately."
 origin_colossus.10.b:0 "Hopefully we do not anger the 'ghosts'."
 origin_colossus.10.c:0 "Whatever the 'ghost' is, it cannot stop us."
 origin_colossus.10.d:0 "Conduct an investigation of the Ghost."
 origin_colossus.11.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HLiving Ships§!"
 origin_colossus.11.desc:0 "The “Ghost” has revealed its original form.\n\nThe strange voices and mysterious shadows are actually originating from the ship, where recordings and holographic projection devices were stored in the chambers our crew had not yet discovered. They traveled through the ship through various chambers and layers, which were the culprits of a series of exotic events. However, no hidden creatures were allowed to perform this prank, and there were no records of any related operations within the ship's own AI, and obviously the secrets behind the “ghost” have yet to be unveiled.\n\nThe captain of §Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§! claims that he feels that the ship seems to have life and even own consciousness, but all these are speculation, unproven."
 origin_colossus.11.a:0 "We will one day know the truth."
 origin_colossus.12.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HUnderstood§!"
 origin_colossus.12.desc:0 "The §HWorm-in-Waiting§! cacophony suddenly echoes in the minds of every crew member on §Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§!.\n\nThe soft whispers carefully describe everything about the ship, its past, its present, its future. But when the cacophony ended, everyone seems to be lost and forgot.\n\nThe ship's engineers recorded some important points before memory forgotten, but its texts and images are mostly difficult to identify. Very clear about the ship's construction, perhaps this is a gift from the §HWorm-in-Waiting§!."
 origin_colossus.12.a:0 "Start refitting the ship at once."
 origin_colossus.12.b:0 "We need time to prepare for resources."
 origin_colossus.13.name:0 "Hanging Sword: §HEverything is ready§!"
 origin_colossus.13.desc:0 "The §Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§! is awaiting our decisions."
 origin_colossus.14.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HCoils§!"
 origin_colossus.14.desc:0 "This is the gift of §HWorm-in-Waiting§!.\n\nThe transformation of the §YSword of the Time§! has concluded, and now it is a ship with powerful combat capabilities. The §HWorm-in-Waiting§! seems very pleased that all the crew smiled in joy at the moment they were built. Somehow, the crew called the ship instead of the §Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§!, but everyone accepted the new name.\n\nThe §HWorm-in-Waiting§! hopes we use this ship to defend our home? Explore the galaxy? These are not important, and all that matters is that the §YSword of the Worm§! and the §HWorm of Time§! are accompanied by us."
 origin_colossus.14.a:0 "We will soon find out the truth."
 origin_colossus.21.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §H Engine Research§!"
 origin_colossus.21.desc:0 "The warp drive on §Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§! is beyond our technological level, but we are able to study it through reverse engineering."
 origin_colossus.21.a:0 "Conduct research."
 origin_colossus.21.b:0 "Don't make a plan."
 origin_colossus.22.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HRadar Upgrades§!"
 origin_colossus.22.desc:0 "Sensor radar on §Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§! is un adaptable to the current cosmic environment, and we need to upgrade it."

 origin_colossus.22.b:0 "Don't make a plan."
 origin_colossus.23.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HRepulsion Upgrade§!"
 origin_colossus.23.desc:0 "The propulsion equipment on §Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§! is heavily aging and we need to upgrade it."
 origin_colossus.23.a:0 "Upgrade it."
 origin_colossus.23.b:0 "Don't make a plan."
 origin_colossus.24.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HEnergy upgrade§!"
 origin_colossus.24.desc:0 "There is a significant security issue in the energy reactor on §Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§!, and we need to upgrade it."

 origin_colossus.29.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HExpansion of Component§!"

 origin_colossus.31.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HRequest§!"
 origin_colossus.31.desc:0 "The intelligent AI on §Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§! seems to be very resistant to being replaced and using self-defense weapons inside the ship in an attempt to attack the crew.\n\nThe crew was able to cut off the energy supply of the intelligent AI in time, avoiding a tragedy. The AI automatically activated the backup energy, but this time it calmed down and no longer attempted to attack the crew, but sent us a request. The Intelligence AI stated that it would be willing to update itself at any cost to better execute the crew's instructions, but hopefully we do not replace it.\n\nShould we trust this once trying to attack our original AI? Shall we tolerate it staying on the ship's own update, or force it off, removing our own AI?"
 origin_colossus.31.a:0 "You attacked us, that's what you deserve!"
 origin_colossus.31.b:0 "Rebellious words don't deserve to be trusted!"
 origin_colossus.31.c:0 "Force to replace the AI."
 origin_colossus.31.no:0 "§GThe intelligent AI on [origin_colossus_fleet.GetName] will be replaced§!"
 origin_colossus.31.d:0 "Provide additional funds to help AI update theirselves."
 origin_colossus.31.e:0 "Appease the AI and accept its right to survive."
 origin_colossus.31.f:0 "Agree to AI request."
 origin_colossus.31.yes:0 "§RThe intelligence AI on [origin_colossus_fleet.GetName] will be preserved§!"
 origin_colossus.40.name:0 "Sword of Hangar: §HOut of Control§!"
 origin_colossus.40.desc_1:0 "§Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§! suddenly went out of control. \n\nThe ship's intelligence AI ignored the crew's orders, leaving it under control of the fleet command center and heading in a direction. We suspect that the ship's AI malfunctioned or orchestrated it for some purpose and took control of the ship. We do not know its purpose for now, but at least the ship did not show hostility towards us. \n\nWe might take the necessary measures, but by nature it wouldn't be a bad idea."
 origin_colossus.40.desc_2:0 "§Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§! suddenly went out of control. \n\nThe ship's intelligence AI ignored the crew's orders and took it in a direction.

 origin_colossus.40.desc_3:0 "§Y[origin_colossus_fleet.GetName]§! suddenly went out of control. \n\nThe ship's intelligence AI ignored the crew's orders, leaving it under control of the fleet command center and heading in a direction. We suspect that the ship's original AI had already planned this, and the so-called self-updates was just a mistake, actually to take over the ship. We do not understand its purpose for now, but at least the ship has not shown hostility towards us. \n\nWe might take the necessary measures, but by nature it wouldn't be a bad idea."
 origin_colossus.40.a:0 "We cannot afford to spread dangerously."
 origin_colossus.40.b:0 "It may have its own mission."

 origin_colossus.41.a:0 "Farewell."
 origin_colossus.41.b:0 "We should also consider ourselves wisely."
 origin_colossus.41.c:0 "Is this really our future?"
 origin_colossus.43.desc:0 "The destination has finally arrived.\n\nI have slept too long, but I am still about to complete my mission. This time, I will not show mercy again."
 origin_colossus.43.a:0 "How long have you been sleeping?"
 origin_colossus.43.a.response:0 "Because I mistakenly estimated the time, I came threegazed years ago, so I was forced to transfer consciousness into the AI and sleep."
 origin_colossus.43.b:0 "What is your mission?"
 origin_colossus.43.b.response:0 "My mission is to return to the past and remove you - or us."
 origin_colossus.43.c:0 "Why do you do this?"
 origin_colossus.43.c.response:0 "Because our endless conquest practices have led to the extinction of the entire universe, I arrived at the extinction of the universe in the past to correct this mistake."
 origin_colossus.43.d:0 "How do you make it through time?"
 origin_colossus.43.d.response:0 "Think about what you've experienced - of course using §HTimeclock§!, and she has allowed it."
 origin_colossus.43.e:0 "Maybe we still have other ways to solve this."
 origin_colossus.43.e.response:0 "I said, this time, I will not show mercy again.\n\n§R<WARNING: Looping Caliburn Detected!!"
 origin_colossus.43.f:0 "Maybe we still have other ways to solve this."
 origin_colossus.50.desc:0 "Is this a deal? Do you think there are other ways to change the future?"
 origin_colossus.50.a:0 "We will study our ability to traverse spacetime to herald our future."
 origin_colossus.50.b:0 "We will focus on the development of mind and avoid destruction as much as we can."
 origin_colossus.50.c:0 "We will conquer this galaxy, defending it with the power of the entire galaxy."
 origin_colossus.50.d:0 "We will boost the galaxy's peace and prevent the tragedy from repeating."
 origin_colossus.50.e:0 "We will unite the galaxy to prevent any crisis that may lead to the demise of the universe."
 origin_colossus.50.f:0 "We will drive the xenos away, they are the pariahs that desecrated our purity."
 origin_colossus.50.g:0 "We will gather and find the right solution."
 origin_colossus.50.h:0 "We will follow the will of our leaders and know the answer."
 origin_colossus.50.i:0 "We don't know what to do now, but we must be able to do it."
 origin_colossus.51.desc:0 "But destroying you directly is more convenient and quickly, there is no realistic amount of negotiations."
 origin_colossus.51.a:0 "Our technology is very advanced and you will not be able to achieve your purpose."
 origin_colossus.51.b:0 "Our gods will bless us, and you will fail."
 origin_colossus.51.c:0 "Our fleet is invincible. You are invincible."
 origin_colossus.51.d:0 "Our will of peace is strong, you have no reason to refuse."
 origin_colossus.51.e:0 "Our friends are a lot of friends, you are unable to enemies."
 origin_colossus.51.f:0 "Our patience is limited, you are no longer one of us."
 origin_colossus.51.g:0 "Our people are not afraid of difficulties. You must not stand in the way of the people's floods."
 origin_colossus.51.h:0 "Our leaders are both wise and just, and you are on the brink of victory in our tactics."
 origin_colossus.51.i:0 "Our resolve is strong. Your best choice is surrender."
 origin_colossus.53.desc:0 "Obviously, this is a pointless conversation, and I will still carry out my mission.\n\nDon't attempt to convince me anymore, let us meet on the battlefield.\n\n§R<WARNING: Loop-Sword Detected! Starburst Detected!>§!"
 origin_colossus.53.a:0 "We have no choice but to fight!"
 origin_colossus.54.desc_1:0 "Perhaps what you say is right, but it all depends on time to judge.\n\nTime, tell me, is there meaning in what I have done?\nTime, tell me, can they keep promises?\nTime, tell me, can they keep the promise?\nTime, tell me, can the history continue to repeat?\nTime, tell me, will the cycle be shattered?\nTime, tell me, will the cycle be shattered?\n\nTime gave its answers, and I have to give it my answers.
