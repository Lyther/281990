This may be related to the reset of the planet several years ago, as the patrol team also observed the “light event” which sent to [waiting_world.GetName] appears to be a mysterious accumulation and released in the form of five light-point, but then it no longer reflects the light, as if it devoured all approaching light."

The barrier on the planet has also become thin, and the environment has returned to a formidable level of survival. Furthermore, we have discovered intelligent life on [waiting_world.GetName], who claim to have been colonists who vanished many years ago, but silent about past experiences.\n\nHowever, the boundary of light in the atmosphere still exists, and perhaps the singularity at the core of the planet has not been completely annihilated."

The time travelers advised to travel through negative phases to avoid the past, which was initially docile, but soon chaos was erupted due to insistance, which led to discontent and anger from the negative civilization. The efforts of conflict further fueled the spread of the crisis, and the spread of the crisis also pushed conflicts, and eventually the entire spacetime was shattered by the pollution.\n\n A legendary captain piloted a sanctuary ship with only one remaining being, using unique abilities to break through the boundaries of spacetime, managed to reach another factor cycle, but at the cost it was wiped out from time and space.\n\n The ship was the last gift from the consequences of being destroyed."
