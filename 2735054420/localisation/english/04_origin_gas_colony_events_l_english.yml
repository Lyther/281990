 gas_colony_change_categories_1_desc:0 "After a preliminary exploration, our science ship has discovered a gas giant very similar to our homeworld. Although we have been unable to determine its inner structure for the time being, this message still pleases us. To confirm whether we can live on this planet, it is best to investigate this gas giant further."

 gas.2.name:0 "Gas Giant Signal"
 gas.2.desc:0 "We have picked up a faint signal emanating from the atmosphere of a gas giant. Which one, or something, is trying to establish contact?"
 gas.2.a:0 "Are there any other gaseous life?"
 gas.10.name:0 "Potential Habitable Gas Giant"
 gas.10.desc:0 "We have discovered a gas giant called §Y[From.GetName]§! in the §Y[From.GetStarName]§! system.\n\nBased on the exploration results from the science ship, the gas giant's internal structure is very similar to our homeworld. Our scientists have analyzed that this gas giant is likely to be our new home. As such, they suggest we make an adaptation attempt on this world immediately, by sending crews to temporarily live on the planet to confirm whether our body structures can adapt to such a environment."
 gas.10.a:0 "This is a bold attempt."
 gas.10.b:0 "Accepted."
 gas.10.c:0 "We had better not risk it easily."
 gas.10.d:0 "Negative."
 gas.200.name:0 "New Home"
 gas.200.desc:0 "After a year of adaptation, a joy has arrived from our science ship.\n\nBased on the results of the experiment, we can fully adapt the environment on §Y[From.From.GetName]§!, and if possible, we can immediately send a colony ship to colonize it. We can believe that after the colonization, the gas giant will become our new home."
 gas.200.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 gas.200.b:0 "New progress."
 gas.300.name:0 "Regrettable Attempt"
 gas.300.desc:0 "Despite their years of effort, this adaptation attempt still ended in failure.\n\nOur scientists had to admit that the previous judgement was wrong. The actual environment within §Y[From.From.GetName]§! is vastly different from our homeworld, and is simply unable to survive in it. After several injuries, our experimental team was forced to withdraw from the gas giant."
 gas.300.a:0 "What a tragedy."
 gas.300.b:0 "A pity."
 gas.21.name:0 "Gaseous Beings: §HNew Missions§!"
 gas.21.desc:0 "With a soothing heart, our colony team has lived on §Y[From.GetName]§! for a long time.\n\nThey have never been able to adapt to the environment of the planet at first, but with a firm belief they have managed to adapt and regulate the planet's rotational direction and atmospheric flow. Now §Y[From.GetName]§! has become a Gas Giant suitable for our habitation, and the colony team has returned to our base safely."
 gas.21.a:0 "This is their little step, but ours a big step!"
 anomaly.5003.desc_1:0 "$anomaly.3005.desc$\n\nHmmm...wait, you are as gaseous as us. How did you make your way off your homeworld? No, that's not important. Since we are all kinds of people, you should be more willing to help us?"

I see, you are a liar, you and those solid guys are all liars, you are all sentient fools!\n\nYou are these people - a plague of the galaxy! One day we will take your place, and we will pay you back to date. Remember me. swept away with the trash of history with the solid age, you gaseous beasts! The true era of gaseous life will come!"

Smuggling others! Fearless idiots! Forget the damn! Sorry...\n\n(Your ships aimed their weapons to them) Hmph- That sphere will give you no trouble! Please, we are wrong, let us leave us alone!"
 baldarak_event_finished:0 "Perhaps we could learn from them."
