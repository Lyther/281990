 origin_voidspawn.0.desc:0 "The environment of this world no longer meets the conditions of spawning, and the spawning of eggs is terminated."
 origin_voidspawn.0.a:0 "Perhaps we missed something."
 origin_voidspawn.1.name:0 "Born at Black Night: §Hstrange shape§!"
 origin_voidspawn.1.desc:0 "Upon entering space, we were able to glimpse the entirety of our homeworld, but the results were creepy to everyone.\n\nOur homeworld was not a beautiful sphere, but a spherical with irregularly spherical and flaws. In addition, the planet's appearance was covered with a “ volcanic” that was evaporating or ready to evaporate, but the lava was filled with a foul smell of stench, as if it was a rotten cough on the corpses of animals.\n\nThough we had taken a lot from the harsh environment on our homeworld, we were able to tremble one by one when we saw the pictures."
 origin_voidspawn.1.a:0 "But after all she is our homeworld."
 origin_voidspawn.2.name:0 "Born at Black Night: §HEarthquake Frequency§!"
 origin_voidspawn.2.desc:0 "The earthquakes on §Y[Target.GetName]§! are becoming more and more frequent. \n\nAlthough we have long been accustomed to earthquakes, earthquakes have appeared too dense and can almost be called earthquakes at every moment. And the level of earthquakes has not slowed down, and we may have to adapt to long-term earthquakes in the next few years."
 origin_voidspawn.2.a:0 "We will adapt."
 origin_voidspawn.3.name:0 "Born at Black Night: §H Eggshell hypothesis§!"
 origin_voidspawn.3.desc:0 "A group of scientists spontaneously studied §Y[Target.GetName]§!.\n\nThe leading scientists have proposed a hypothesis based on the research results: §Y[Target.GetName]§! is actually eggs of some kind of creature, and the surface on which we live is actually eggs. The hypothesis is not empty winds as the research results indicate that the underground eggs of §Y[Target.GetName]§! are extremely similar to the colours of the common birds.\n\nThe leading scientists have stated that the eggs beneath our feet may be in a hatch, and it has a potentially broken shell at any time. However, he has admitted that the hypothesis has not been fully confirmed and remains to wait further research results."
 origin_voidspawn.3.a:0 "We will find out the truth."
 origin_voidspawn.3.b:0 "They are able to investigate clearly."
 origin_voidspawn.4.name:0 "Born at night: §HWhat is really happening§!"
 origin_voidspawn.4.desc_1:0 "The volcano on §Y[Target.GetName]§! was never-ending, but our investigation has reached its end. \n\nWe have learned an unfortunate news: the egg shell is correct, right under our feet, a mysterious creature sleeping in the heart of the planet's heavy shell. As far as the planet is currently speaking, the egg's broken shell has moved closer. \n\nThe event has caused panic among the population, and some have already prepared to evacuate the planet, and some have chosen to remain on the homeworld and believe that things will be going on again."
 origin_voidspawn.4.desc_2:0 "The volcano on §Y[Target.GetName]§! is never-ending to evaporate, but our scientists' investigation has begun.\n\nWe have learned an unfortunate news: the egg shell, supposedly correct, lies beneath our feet, a mysterious creature sleeping in the heart of the planet's heavy shell. Judging by the planet's current situation, the egg's cracking day is coming close.\n\nThe event has caused panic among the population, and some have already chosen to evacuate the planet, but more have chosen to stay on the homeworld and believe that something will be going on."
 origin_voidspawn.4.a:0 "We will make our own choice."
 origin_voidspawn.5.name:0 "Born at Black Night: §HThe Long Night will Be§!"
 origin_voidspawn.5.desc:0 "The broken shell is within our reach, and there is little time left..."
 origin_voidspawn.5.a:0 "We will surely save our homeworld."
 origin_voidspawn.5.b:0 "Prepare to arrange for evacuation."
 origin_voidspawn.6.name:0 "Born at night: §HDisappeared§!"
 origin_voidspawn.6.desc_1:0 "The cataclysm has fallen on §Y[Target.GetName]§!! The last wave of violent tectonic rupture has utterly ripped through the colony's wreck, and beneath the crust, a terrible Voidspawn appeared as nightmares! We tried to save our homeworld, but we lost time."
 origin_voidspawn.6.desc_2:0 "Catastrophe has struck on §Y[Target.GetName]§!! The last wave of violent tectonic rupture has utterly ripped through the colony's wreckage, under the empty crust, a terrible Voidspawn appeared as a nightmare! It has gone against all the laws, but there is no other explanation."
 origin_voidspawn.6.a:0 "It finally hatched."
 origin_voidspawn.6.b:0 "We don't have to deal with it."
 origin_voidspawn.11.name:0 "Born at Black Night: §H tentacles§!"
 origin_voidspawn.11.desc:0 "Our investigation into the egg shell has made a lot of progress, and the truth is within our reach, but it still takes a while to get results."
 origin_voidspawn.11.a:0 "I can't wait to know the truth."
 origin_voidspawn.11.b:0 "Waiting quietly."
 origin_voidspawn.12.name:0 "Born at night: §HPath of Redemption§!"
 origin_voidspawn.12.desc:0 "We have re-gathered our research data on the eggs, and finally found our path to salvation.\n\nThe eggs' spawn is not irreversible, and the eggs' spawn may slow down and even stop as long as the eggs' spawn does not meet the conditions of eggs' spawn. Researchers have discovered that the crust's organic matter is extremely easy to combine with some kind of rare element and produce a series of infectious and toxic substances. After preliminary testing, the substance is not strong enough to our poison, but it appears to pose a great threat to life in the eggs, and the progress of the eggs has slowed down a lot.\n\nIf we can mass-produce such poisons, perhaps we could have a chance to kill the creatures in the eggs and save our homeworld."
 origin_voidspawn.12.a:0 "Produces this type of matter at any cost."
 origin_voidspawn.12.b:0 "But it is also life."
 origin_voidspawn.12.c:0 "The price is too great."
 origin_voidspawn.13.name:0 "Born at Black Night: §HGass of Wrath§!"
 origin_voidspawn.13.desc:0 "The dark night is over, the dawn is near.\n\nOur plans have been successful, and the creatures in the egg will eventually die under the invasion of toxic substances, and the day of broken shells will never arrive. Although our homeworld is broken by a series of changes, we will forever love her, and we will always be by her side, as she will accompany us for the long night in the development of civilization."
 origin_voidspawn.13.a:0 "Our homeworld, we love you forever."
 origin_voidspawn.14.name:0 "Born at Black Night: §HCute Life§!"
 origin_voidspawn.14.desc:0 "Our pacification work has been successful. The Voidspawn is very obedient to our orders, I think it likes us."
 origin_voidspawn.14.a:0 "We are also its homeworld."
 origin_voidspawn.15.name:0 "Born at Black Night: §HDreadnaught§!"
 origin_voidspawn.15.desc:0 "Our pacification work failed, and the Voidspawn still showed strong aggressiveness to us, I think it hates us."
 origin_voidspawn.15.a:0 "Are you going to treat us that way?"
 origin_voidspawn.16.name:0 "Born at Black Night: §H Too late§!"
 origin_voidspawn.16.desc:0 "Our peaceful work has not yielded results, and the Voidspawn has been wiped out."
 origin_voidspawn.16.a:0 "A poor little guy."
