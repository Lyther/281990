 ponycountry.44.title:0 "Defeat of defence"

 ponycountry.5.title:0 "Darkfall"

 harmony.11.b.response:0 "Thank you very much! You won't regret it!"
 harmony.12.desc:0 "Without our permission, the drug company, Hygeia, privately bribed many officials to put their products on the market. That's not all. Their "§YVitality Water§!" is actually just fermented apple juice with other ingredients that look like "effective". As for the prevention and cure they claim, it's just a placebo effect.\nOf course, they are all old liars who know how to shut the mouth of those who know it.

 harmony.13.desc:0 "Our team of investigators found out the incredible secret behind Hygeia Company.\nIn fact, Hygeia has no ability to develop drugs at all. What they are good at is some high-end deception and sales skills. As for the "§YVitality Water§!", it's just fermented apple juice. However, because we did not know the company's details, our investigation was hindered at the beginning. But soon after, we received an anonymous letter, which detailed the secrets behind the company, and sent with it is a lot of strong evidence about the company's fraud.\nAs for the owner of this anonymous letter, according to the letter, she is a salesman of Hygeia Company.

 harmony.14.desc:0 "Unbelievable, that drug company, Hygeia Company, is a thorough "fraud company".\nWhat they're selling is actually just fermented apple juice with other ingredients that look like "effective". As for the prevention and cure they claim, it's just a placebo effect.\nOf course, they know how to shut up the insiders, but thanks to a few brave and honest citizens to come forward and tell the truth, the scam can be effectively stopped.

 harmony.21.desc:0 "Our troops were besieged by beasts in the forest, and they were completely destroyed.

 harmony.21.a:0 "Hoping there is another way..."
 harmony.22.desc:0 "After investigation, we found that because the development of our town destroyed Everfree Forest and the habitat of the nearby animals, the forest would retaliate against us in this way.

All the ponies evacuated the area immediately before things got worse.\n\nIn view of the above situation, [Root.GetLeaderName] decided to send UAVs to investigate this area. After a search, they finally found the source, a strange old device, which seems to have been there for hundreds of years. After destroying it, the screams and discomfort in that area disappeared.

[Root.GetLeaderName] found an old device that looks hundreds of years old in the center of one area, which seems to be the source of strange readings on the sensor.\n\nAfter testing, this device seems to be able to release a force field then destroy any life within its scope.

 griffincountry.101.title:0 "Great Rift Valley"
 griffincountry.101.desc:0 "While sorting out the data, the [griffin_arc_scientist.GetName] found an anomaly in the [griffin_arc.GetName]'s analytical data. Perhaps inadvertently, this data exception did not attract attention. After another investigation of [griffin_arc.GetName], [griffin_arc_scientist.GetName] found that there was a huge rift on the planet that had not been found before. The rift seems to have just formed. [griffin_arc_scientist.GetSheHe] speculated that the rift may have been formed long ago, but its upper part was covered by relatively fragile structure. After geological movement, the top collapsed, exposing the rift.[griffin_arc_scientist.GetName] say it is almost impossible for nature to form such a rift valley, and [griffin_arc_scientist.GetName] hopes to investigate it."

And the analysis of rock strata shows that there are many kinds of ore veins here, and the reserves are very rich.\n\nAlthough they have dropped about one kilometer from the surface, it still looks bottomless below.

Although these skeletons are at least several million years old and seem to have evolved very primitive, they still make the exploration team very happy.\n\nNext, the team explored in the direction of more and more dense skeletons, and finally stopped in front of a narrow passage blocked by many stones. These structures look very unstable and may collapse if team dosen't take carefully. The exploration team can only carefully clear out a passage."

 griffincountry.140.desc:0 "After clearing out the passage and successfully crossing it, all the members of the exploration team were shocked. Because in front of us is a huge remains of primitive civilization. Crisscross caves and passages constitute this huge and complex underground world. It is difficult to imagine how these primitive creatures dug caves to build their homes, how they lived, and what their origins were. All kinds of questions were like a fog over every member of the team. Everyone looked at each other, so they decided to go deeper and find out.\n\nFinally, they came to the largest cave in the underground world. There are many pictures of this race living underground on the cave wall, but the most curious thing is that this underground race seems to worship a golden metal sculpture with peculiar shape as a god statue. However, the place where it was placed had already been seriously damaged, leaving behind a dark hole with heat waves."

And the heat waves at that cave entrance came from the magma at the bottom of the cave.\n\nJust below the cave, the team found the skeleton of a large creature, but it had only one eye, which was not the same species as the creature above. All the underground things made all the team members feel extremely crazy. What kind of conditions created these underground creatures, and how did they die out from the planet? What happened to this planet?\n\nJust when everyone was in a daze, a team member found that there was a golden light in the cave not far away from the remains. After checking, they found that there were many treasures, as well as the statues on the murals! When a team member was about to pick up the statue, there was a strange wind around the statue, and everyone had a strange feeling from the heart. There is no doubt that this discovery has added mystery to the planet.\n\nHowever, due to the limitation of equipment, the exploration team can not take too many things, but on the whole, the harvest is still a lot."

He rowed his boat along a brook, not mindful of how far he had toured, when suddenly he came across a blossoming peach grove flanking the banks continuously for hundreds offootsteps. The peach grove with no other sundry trees permeated with sweet fragrance, freshgreen grass, and falling and fallen blossoms. Amazed by what he saw, the fisherman rowedfurther, with a desire to explore how far it extended."

Afterthe fisherman answered all the questions, he was invited to their homes where they servedwine and killed chicken to offer a feast. When the news of the fisherman'visit spread out toother villagers, they all came to greet him. Then, they told the outsider that their ancestors, fleeing from disorders and chaos during the Qin Period, had come with their wives andchildren to this idyllic land, and had never gone out since, leaving themselves secluded fromoutsiders. When they asked what dynasty it was at present, they had no idea there had beendynasties such as Han, Wei and Jin. The outsider related all he knew in detail, event by event, and they heaved frequent sighs and sorrows. The villages by turns invited him to their houseswhere he was entertained with wine and food. He stayed for a few days. When he decided toleave, people of this place reminded him, "It's better not to reveal this place to others.""

 eqgcountry.101.a:0 "We need to start investigating this matter."
 eqgcountry.102.title:0 "Another world"
 eqgcountry.102.desc:0 "After talking to one of them who looks like a leader, we learned that they actually come from a parallel universe. However, they are not human like us, but a species called pony.\n\nAt first, our scientists did not believe their words and thought it was nonsense. But after showing us their world - a magical world called Equestria, we completely believed it. Who would have thought that the entrance connecting the other world was on the statue pedestal in an abandoned warehouse?\n\nAnd about magic, their world has magic, which only exists in fantasy, and it can even work in our world!? It seems necessary for us to have a good communication."
 eqgcountry.102.a:0 "Prepare for communication with their leader."
 eqgcountry.110.title:0 "Myself of the other world"
 eqgcountry.110.desc:0 "Hello, [Root.GetRulerName], or myself, ha ha. My team must have told you a lot. Maybe you still have many questions. I can answer them one by one."
 eqgcountry.110.a:0 "You are ... talking horses?"
 eqgcountry.110.a.response:0 "Ha ha ha, very interesting description.\n\nYes, ponies are our main species. The basic operation mode of our society is composed of three races, namely, Earth Pony, Unicorn and Pegasi. Maybe you can hardly believe that Earth Pony is responsible for agriculture, Unicorn masters magic, and Pegasi is responsible for controlling the weather. In addition, there are a very small number of Alicorns. They have nearly endless life span and powerful magic. They usually hold important positions in our society, such as leaders.\n\nHowever, with the progress of our society, we have gradually established a deep relationship with other races on our planet, such as Griffin, Dragon, Changeling, Kirin, etc. Our world is ushering in a golden age, where all living creatures can perform their duties and exert their best abilities."
 eqgcountry.110.b:0 "Talk about the magic you said."
 eqgcountry.110.b.response:0 "Magic is the most unique and most important thing in our world. It is almost the foundation of our world. It has many classifications, and almost all organisms contain the power of magic, but only such races as unicorns can bring it into play. However, with the deepening of our research on magic, all species have the opportunity to learn and use magic through magic instruments and other magic media.\n\nMagic like levitation, teleportation and so on are just the foundation. We have applied magic to various production and research. This is a bit similar to science, but it is two completely different paths. Although we study science as well as magic, we are far behind you in this respect."
 eqgcountry.110.c:0 "About the portal."
 eqgcountry.110.c.response:0 "The portal is the channel connecting our two worlds. Any creature passing through it will come to the other world and become the creature corresponding to that world.\n\nWe have studied this for a long time. It can be formed naturally or artificially. Generally speaking, it is attached to an object in two worlds that can generate mirror reflection. A mirror, or even a lake, can be its passageway.\n\nThe portal is not always opened, but is opened every other period of time. The duration and interval are different. Although we have mastered the method of permanently opening the portal, it will cause instability of the portal, which may bring danger to both connected worlds."
 eqgcountry.110.d:0 "Why do you come to our world."
 eqgcountry.111.desc:0 "Then I'll go straight to the subject. A few years ago, a theft occurred in one of our warehouses, and a magic creation was lost. We attach great importance to it. After all, all the magic instruments stored in this warehouse are very dangerous.\n\nUnfortunately, we did not find the suspect and the creation for a long time, until we detected abnormal energy in the portal, from which we determined that the suspect came to your world. In our world, this creation may not have a serious impact, but after passing through the portal, we detected that its energy began to become unstable, which may cause serious consequences in your world.\n\nOn behalf of all our citizens, I would like to express our deep regret for involving your country in this avoidable event. It is hoped that your country can facilitate and assist our investigation, arrest the suspects as soon as possible, and recover the lost artifacts to avoid losses."
 eqgcountry.111.a:0 "We will help you."

 eqgcountry.210.desc:0 "The other world informs us of an unfortunate news. Just a few days ago, the signal sent by the creation we tracked declined. Perhaps the suspect found out our action and began to act cautiously. They suggested that we expand the search scope and improve the search accuracy.\n\nIn this regard, they can improve the original signal receiver and search the whole planet to find the attenuated signal source."
 eqgcountry.210.a:0 "Provide funds to accelerate improvement."
 eqgcountry.210.b:0 "Urge improvement and continue searching."

 eqgcountry.212.a:0 "A communication came."
 eqgcountry.213.desc:0 "On behalf of all our citizens, I would like to express our deep condolences to all the victims in your country.\n\nI'm sorry that we failed to stop this incident that could have been prevented. Please accept these humanitarian aid. This is the only thing we can do."

 eqgcountry.214.a:0 "This may be a good idea."
 eqgcountry.215.desc:0 "The receiver successfully searched for the weak signal sent by the creation. Our arrest team successfully located and arrested the suspect before he moved his position. Magic creation is also recycled."

 eqgcountry.222.desc:0 "Perhaps the suspect shifted his position in the space of our planet scanning, and we did not find the signal sent by the creation.\n\nScholars from the other world suggest that we further improve the receiver, place it on our star base, and conduct synchronous search for all planets in our territory."
 eqgcountry.222.a:0 "Appropriation preparation."
 eqgcountry.222.b:0 "Unable to provide more assistance temporarily, continue to use planetary scanning."
