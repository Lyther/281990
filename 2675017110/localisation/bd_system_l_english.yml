START_SCREEN_bd_origin_outside:0"Our race was born about 2,000 years ago, and we have always thought that our homeland is as beautiful as paradise, as mysterious as the two black moons in the sky and the other two worlds in the sky, and we have been in space for nearly a hundred years, but we have not been able to reach the two worlds in the sky - they are all shrouded in a barrier that we cannot understand.\n\n At the same time we found four planets that were almost identical to our parent star, and more coincidentally, they were all in the same orbit as our parent star and all had 6 moons. This discovery once led to serious misunderstandings about science. \n\nAfter getting rid of the influence of the inherent thinking, our technology exploded, and now we have found a gateway at the edge of the galaxy, perhaps through which we can enter a new world..."

START_SCREEN_bd_origin_unlimited:0"We were born on a planet that outsiders can't imagine. On this planet, we perfectly meet all our material and spiritual needs. Everyone knows that contentment is always happy. It can be called a Utopia in people's eyes. We didn't even know the word 'crime' before the discovery of alien civilization.\n\nNot only that, our home planet [gethomeworldname] has one of the most important features: Unlimited。As long as we operate properly, our home planet will expand to a higher dimension, and no matter how many people are here, it will not be crowded.\n\nBut we noticed that our parent star is located inside a huge black hole, which may have created our special world, but the gravity of the black hole also makes it difficult for us to get rid of it, and we have been trapped here for a long time.Now, with the progress of our science and technology and a little luck, we have finally rushed out of the horizon of the black hole and established the first star base. We are about to get rid of the long-standing gravity and enter the real galaxy."

START_SCREEN_bd_origin_watcher:0"The galaxy is boundless, but we seem to be alone,We can't really get rid of the Galactic gravity well, so we started the 'sentry project': building an extremely wide range of sensor arrays.\n\nafter several generations of efforts, our §H$spy_orb_4$§! has succeeded, and we have also determined that we are lonely: through the §H$spy_orb_4$§!, we can observe that other galaxies seem to have a channel that can get rid of gravity wells, which we call hyperspace channel, but our galaxy does not have such a channel, which means that we can't navigate through hyperspace channel.Although it is certain that other civilizations in the universe exist, it still can not change the fact that we are lonely, which has brought us a great blow.\n\nBut we did not give up, with the help of the §H$spy_orb_4$§!, we looked at the Milky Way here, and in the long observation, our scientists came up with a bold idea: to build a special stargate. Perhaps because of our perseverance, or perhaps by luck, our stargate was built successfully, and we named it the 'Watcher Gate' and its other end leads to the Milky Way, which is the closest group of galaxies to us. Today, we will shake off our long-standing loneliness and officially step into the universe."
