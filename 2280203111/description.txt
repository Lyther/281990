Crisis will be able to spawn 5 years into the end-game, and multiple crisis are able to exist at the same time.
This mod also increases the chance of a crisis happening, so expect them sooner than in vanilla.

Overrides events/crisis_trigger_event.txt

Every 5 years, Stellaris rolls a dice and decides which crisis to trigger, including an option of not triggering any of them. I've posted 3 pictures with their chances of being triggered.
Not only are the chances higher right after entering the End Game, but it also increases faster.
When a crisis is was triggered, it increases the chances of the other crises triggering the next time (visible on the 3rd picture).
